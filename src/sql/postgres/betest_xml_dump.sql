Choose the best answer to each question.<br/> <br/>PASSAGE I<br/><br/>Crinoline and croquet are out. As yet, no political activists have thrown themselves in front of the royal horse on Derby Day. Even so, some historians can spot the parallels. It is a time of rapid technological change. It is a period when the dominance of the world''s superpower is coming under threat. It is an epoch when prosperity masks underlying economic strain. And, crucially, it is a time when policy-makers are confident that all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds. Welcome to the Edwardian Summer of the second age of globalisation.<br/><br/>Spare a moment to take stock of what''s been happening in the past few months. Let''s start with the oil price, which has rocketed to more than $65 a barrel, more than double its level 18 months ago. The accepted wisdom is that we shouldn''t worry our little heads about that, because the incentives are there for business to build new production and refining capacity, which will effortlessly bring demand and supply back into balance and bring crude prices back to S25 a barrel. As Tommy Cooper used to say, ''just like that''. Then there is the result of the French referendum on the European Constitution, seen as thick-headed luddites railing vainly against the modern world. What the French needed to realise, the argument went, was that there was no alternative to the reforms that would make the country more flexible, more competitive, more dynamic. Just the sort of reforms that allowed Gate Gourmet to sack hundreds of its staff at Heathrow after the sort of ultimatum that used to be handed out by Victorian mill owners. An alternative way of looking at the French non" is that our neighbours translate "flexibility" as "you''re fired".<br/><br/>Finally, take a squinl at the United States. Just like Britain a century ago, a period of unquestioned superiority is drawing to a close. China is still a long way from matching America''s wealth, but it is growing at a stupendous rate and economic strength brings geopolitical clout. Already, there is evidence of a new scramble for Africa as Washington and Beijing compete for oil stocks. Moreover, beneath the surface of the US economy, all is not well. Growth looks healthy enough, but the competition from China and elsewhere has meant the world''s biggest economy now imports far more than it exports. The US is living beyond its means, but in this time of studied complacency a current account deficit worth 6 percent of gross domestic product is seen as a sign of strength, not weakness. In this new Edwardian summer, comfort is taken from the fact that dearer oil has not had the savage inflationary consequences of 1973-74, when a fourfold increase in the cost of crude brought an abrupt end to a postwar boom that had gone on uninterrupted for a quarter of a century. True, the cost of living has been affected by higher transport costs, but we are talking of inflation at 2.3 per cent and not 27 per cent. Yet the idea that higher oil prices are of little consequence is fanciful. If people are paying more to fill up their cars it leaves them with less to spend on everything else, but there is a reluctance to consume less. In the 1970s unions were strong and able to negotiate large, compensatory pay deals that served to intensify inflationary pressure. In 2005, that avenue is pretty much closed off, but the abolition of all the controls on credit that existed in the 1970s means that households are invited to borrow more rather than consume less. The knock-on effects of higher oil prices are thus felt in different ways - through high levels of indebtedness, in inflated asset prices, and in balance of payments deficits.<br/><br/>There are those who point out, rightly, that modern industrial capitalism has proved mightily resilient these past 250 years, and that a sign of the enduring strength of the system has been the way it apparently shrugged off everything - a stock market crash, 9/11, rising oil prices - that have been thrown at it in the half decade since the millennium. Even so, there are at least three reasons for concern. First, we have been here before. In terms of political economy, the first era of globalisation mirrored our own. There was a belief in unfettered capital flows, in free trade, and in the power of the market. It was a time of massive income inequality and unprecedented migration. Eventually, though, there was a backlash, manifested in a struggle between free traders and protectionists, and in rising labour militancy.<br/><br/>Second, the world is traditionally at its most fragile at times when the global balance of power is in flux. By the end of the nineteenth century, Britain''s role as the hegemonic power was being challenged by the rise of the United States, Germany, and Japan while the Ottoman and Hapsburg empires were clearly in rapid decline, Looking ahead from 2005, it is clear that over the next two or three decades, both China and India - which together account for half the world''s population - will flex their muscles. Finally, there is the question of what rising oil prices tell us. The emergence of China and India means global demand for crude is likely to remain high at a time when experts say production is about to top out. If supply constraints start to bite, any declines in the price are likely to be short-term cyclical affairs punctuating a long upward trend.<br/><br/> ]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[4]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[What, according to the author, has resulted in a widespread belief in the resilience of modern capitalism? ]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[Growth in the economies of Western countries despite shocks in the form of increase in levels of indebtedness and inflated asset prices.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Increase in the prosperity of Western countries and China despite rising oil prices]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Continued growth of Western economies despite a rise in terrorism, an increase in oil prices and other similar shocks.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[The success of continued reforms aimed at making Western economies more dynamic, competitive and efficient. ]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section II - Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[Directions for Questions 41 to 48:<br/><br/>Each of the two passages given below is followed by a set of four questions.

Choose the best answer to each question.<br/> <br/>PASSAGE II<br/><br/>While complex in the extreme, Derrida''s work has proven to be a particularly influential approach to the analysis of the ways in which language structures our understanding of ourselves and the world we inhabit, an approach he termed deconstruction. In its simplest formulation, deconstruction can be taken to refer to a methodological strategy which seeks to uncover layers of hidden meaning in a text that have been denied or suppressed. The term ''text'', in this respect, does not refer simply to a written form of communication, however. Rather, texts are something we all produce and reproduce constantly in our everyday social relations, be they spoken, written or embedded in the construction of material artifacts. At the heart of Derrida''s deconstructive approach is his critique of what he perceives to be the totalitarian impulse of the Enlightenment pursuit to bring all that exists in the world under the domain of a representative language, a pursuit he refers to as logocentrism. Logocentrism is the search for a rational language that is able to know and represent the world and all its aspects perfectly and accurately. Its totalitarian dimension, for Derrida at least, lies primarily in its tendency to marginalize or dismiss all that does not neatly comply with its particular linguistic representations, a tendency that, throughout history, has all too frequently been manifested in the form of authoritarian institutions. Thus logocentrism has, in its search for the truth of absolute representation, subsumed difference and oppressed that which it designates as its alien ''other''. For Derrida, western civilization has been built upon such a systematic assault on alien cultures and ways of life, typically in the name of reason and progress.<br/><br/>In response to logocentrism, deconstruction posits the idea that the mechanism by which this process of marginalization and the ordering of truth occurs is through establishing systems of binary opposition. Oppositional linguistic dualisms, such as rational/ irrational, culture/nature and good/bad are not, however, construed as equal partners as they are in, say, the semiological structuralism of Saussure. Rather, they exist, for Derrida, in a series of hierarchical relationships with the first term normally occupying a superior position. Derrida defines the relationship between such oppositional terms using the neologism differance. This refers to the realization that in any statement, oppositional terms differ from each other (for instance, the difference between rationality and irrationality is constructed through oppositional usage), and at the same time, a hierarchical relationship is maintained by the deference of one term to the other (in the positing of rationality over irrationality, for instance). It is this latter point which is perhaps the key to understanding Derrida''s approach to deconstruction.<br/><br/>For the fact that at any given time one term must defer to its oppositional ''other'', means that the two terms are constantly in a state of interdependence. The presence of one is dependent upon the absence or ''absent-presence'' of the ''other'', such as in the case of good and evil, whereby to understand the nature of one, we must constantly relate it to the absent term in order to grasp its meaning. That is, to do good, we must understand that our act is not evil for without that comparison the term becomes meaningless. Put simply, deconstruction represents an attempt to demonstrate the absent-presence of this oppositional ''other'', to show that what we say or write is in itself not expressive simply of what is present, but also of what is absent. Thus, deconstruction seeks to reveal the interdependence of apparently dichotomous terms and their meanings relative to their textual context; that is, within the linguistic power relations which structure dichotomous terms hierarchically. In Derrida''s own words, a deconstructive reading "must always aim at a certain relationship, unperceived by the writer, between what he commands and what he does not command of the patterns of a language that he uses. . . .[It] attempts to make the not-seen accessible to sight."<br/><br/>Meaning, then, is never fixed or stable, whatever the intention of the author of a text. For Derrida, language is a system of relations that are dynamic, in that all meanings we ascribe to the world are dependent not only on what we believe to be present but also on what is absent. Thus, any act of interpretation must refer not only to what the author of a text intends, but also to what is absent from his or her intention. This insight leads, once again, to Derrida''s further rejection of the idea of the definitive authority of the intentional agent or subject. The subject is decentred; it is conceived as the outcome of relations of differance. As author of its own biography, the subject thus becomes the ideological fiction of modernity and its logocentric philosophy, one that depends upon the formation of hierarchical dualisms, which repress and deny the presence of the absent ''other''. No meaning can, therefore, ever be definitive, but is merely an outcome of a particular interpretation.<br/><br/> ]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[3]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[To Derrida, ''logocentrism'' does not imply ]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[A totalitarian impulse.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[A domain of representative language.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Interdependence of the meanings of dichotomous terms.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[A strategy that seeks to suppress hidden meanings in a text. ]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section II - Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[Directions for Questions 41 to 48:<br/><br/>Each of the two passages given below is followed by a set of four questions.

In its simplest formulation, deconstruction can be taken to refer to a methodological strategy which seeks to uncover layers of hidden meaning in a text that have been denied or suppressed.

Rather, texts are something we all produce and reproduce constantly in our everyday social relations, be they spoken, written or embedded in the construction of material artifacts.

In the first round, the highest seeded player plays the lowest seeded player (seed # 32) which is designated match No. 1 of first round; the 2nd seeded player plays the 31st seeded player which is designated match No. 2 of the first round, and so on. Thus, for instance, match No. 16 of first round is to be played between 16lh seeded player and the 17th seeded player. In the second round, the winner of match No. 1 of-first round plays the winner of match No. 16 of first round and is designated match No. I of second round. Similarly, the winner of match No, 2 of first round plays the winner of match No. 15 of first round, and is designated match No. 2 of second round. Thus, for instance, match No. 8 of the second round is to be played between the winner of match No. 8 of first round and the winner of match No. 9 of first round.

Choose the best answer for each question.<br/><br/>PASSAGE - I<br/><br/>To the average educated person of the present day, the obvious starting point of mathematics would be the series of whole numbers,<br/> 1, 2, 3, 4, ... etc.<br/><br/>Probably only a person with some mathematical knowledge would think of beginning with 0 instead of with 1, but we will presume this degree of knowledge; we will take as our starting-point the series:<br/> 0, 1, 2, 3, ...n, n+ 1,....., <br/>and it is this series that we shall mean when we speak of the ''series of natural numbers''.<br/>It is only at a high stage of civilization that we could take this series as our starting-point. It must have required many ages to discover that a brace of pheasants and a couple of days were both instances of the number 2: the degree of abstraction involved is far from easy. And the discovery that 1 is a number must have been difficult. As for 0, it is a very recent addition; the Greeks and Romans had no such digit. If we had been embarking upon mathematical philosophy in earlier days, we should have had to start with something less abstract than the series of natural numbers, which we should reach as a stage on our backward journey. When the logical foundations of mathematics have grown more familiar, we shall be able to start further back, at what is now a late stage in our analysis. But for the moment the natural numbers seem to represent what is easiest and most familiar in mathematics.<br/><br/>But though familiar, they are not understood. Very few people are prepared with a definition of what is meant by '' number'', or ''0'', or ''1''. It is not very difficult tc see that, starting from 0, any other of the natural numbers can be reached by repeated additions of 1, but we shall have to define what we mean by ''adding 1'', and what we mean by ''repeated''. These questions are by no means easy. It was believed until recently that some, at least, of these first notions of arithmetic must be accepted as too simple and primitive to be defined. Since all terms that are defined are defined by means of other ''terms'', it is clear that human knowledge must always be content to accept some terms as intelligible without definition, in order to have a starting-point for its definitions. It is not clear that there must be terms which are incapable of definition: it is possible that, however far back we go in defining, we always might go further still. On the other hand, it is also possible that, when analysis has been pushed far enough, we can reach terms that really are simple, and therefore, logically incapable of the sort of definition that consists in analyzing. This is a question which it is not necessary for us to decide; for our purposes, it is sufficient to observe that, since human powers are finite, the definitions known to us must always begin somewhere, with terms undefined for the moment, though perhaps not permanently.<br/><br/>All traditional pure mathematics, including analytical geometry, may be regarded as consisting wholly of propositions about the natural numbers. That is to say, the terms which occur can be defined by means of the natural numbers, and the propositions can be deduced from the properties of the natural numbers - with the addition, in each case, of the ideas and propositions of pure logic.<br/><br/>That all traditional pure mathematics can be derived from the natural numbers is a fairly recent discovery, though it had long been suspected. Pythagoras, who believed that not only mathematics, but everything else could be deduced from numbers, was the discoverer of the most serious obstacle in the way of what is called the ''arithmetising'' of mathematics. It was Pythagoras who discovered the existence of incommensurables, and, in particular, the incommensurability of the side of a square and the diagonal. If the length of the side is 1 inch, the number of inches in the diagonal is the square root of 2, which appeared not to be a number at all. The problem thus raised was solved only in our own day, and was only solved completely by the help of the reduction of arithmetic to logic, which I shall go into later. For the present, we shall take for granted the arithmetisation of mathematics, though this was a feat of the very greatest importance.<br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[4]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[Why does the author think that ''it is only at a high stage of civilization'' that we could take the series of natural numbers as our starting-point?]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[Because 0 was only a recent discovery.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[The natural numbers seem to represent what is easiest and most familiar in mathematics.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[It must have taken a long time to equate many things with numbers.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Earlier, some of these first notions of arithmetic were accepted as too simple and primitive to be defined.]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section I - Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[Section - I<br/>Direction for questions 1 to 14: Each of the three passages given below is followed by questions.

Choose the best answer for each question.<br/><br/>PASSAGE - I<br/><br/>To the average educated person of the present day, the obvious starting point of mathematics would be the series of whole numbers,<br/> 1, 2, 3, 4, ... etc.<br/><br/>Probably only a person with some mathematical knowledge would think of beginning with 0 instead of with 1, but we will presume this degree of knowledge; we will take as our starting-point the series:<br/> 0, 1, 2, 3, ...n, n+ 1,....., <br/>and it is this series that we shall mean when we speak of the ''series of natural numbers''.<br/>It is only at a high stage of civilization that we could take this series as our starting-point. It must have required many ages to discover that a brace of pheasants and a couple of days were both instances of the number 2: the degree of abstraction involved is far from easy. And the discovery that 1 is a number must have been difficult. As for 0, it is a very recent addition; the Greeks and Romans had no such digit. If we had been embarking upon mathematical philosophy in earlier days, we should have had to start with something less abstract than the series of natural numbers, which we should reach as a stage on our backward journey. When the logical foundations of mathematics have grown more familiar, we shall be able to start further back, at what is now a late stage in our analysis. But for the moment the natural numbers seem to represent what is easiest and most familiar in mathematics.<br/><br/>But though familiar, they are not understood. Very few people are prepared with a definition of what is meant by '' number'', or ''0'', or ''1''. It is not very difficult tc see that, starting from 0, any other of the natural numbers can be reached by repeated additions of 1, but we shall have to define what we mean by ''adding 1'', and what we mean by ''repeated''. These questions are by no means easy. It was believed until recently that some, at least, of these first notions of arithmetic must be accepted as too simple and primitive to be defined. Since all terms that are defined are defined by means of other ''terms'', it is clear that human knowledge must always be content to accept some terms as intelligible without definition, in order to have a starting-point for its definitions. It is not clear that there must be terms which are incapable of definition: it is possible that, however far back we go in defining, we always might go further still. On the other hand, it is also possible that, when analysis has been pushed far enough, we can reach terms that really are simple, and therefore, logically incapable of the sort of definition that consists in analyzing. This is a question which it is not necessary for us to decide; for our purposes, it is sufficient to observe that, since human powers are finite, the definitions known to us must always begin somewhere, with terms undefined for the moment, though perhaps not permanently.<br/><br/>All traditional pure mathematics, including analytical geometry, may be regarded as consisting wholly of propositions about the natural numbers. That is to say, the terms which occur can be defined by means of the natural numbers, and the propositions can be deduced from the properties of the natural numbers - with the addition, in each case, of the ideas and propositions of pure logic.<br/><br/>That all traditional pure mathematics can be derived from the natural numbers is a fairly recent discovery, though it had long been suspected. Pythagoras, who believed that not only mathematics, but everything else could be deduced from numbers, was the discoverer of the most serious obstacle in the way of what is called the ''arithmetising'' of mathematics. It was Pythagoras who discovered the existence of incommensurables, and, in particular, the incommensurability of the side of a square and the diagonal. If the length of the side is 1 inch, the number of inches in the diagonal is the square root of 2, which appeared not to be a number at all.

Wealthy businessmen in Asia didn''t bother to tell investors the truth about their assets and liabilities or their profits; the aura of invincibility that came from their political connections was enough. Only when a financial crisis came along did people take a hard look at their businesses, which promptly collapsed.<br/><br/>Does this sound familiar?<br/><br/>On the face of it, the sudden political storm over Enron is puzzling. After all, the Bush administration didn''t save the company from bankruptcy. But then why did the administration dissemble so long about its contacts with Enron? Why did George W. Bush make the absurd claim that Enron''s CEO, Kenneth Lay, opposed him in his first run for governor, and that the two men got to know each other only after that race? And why does the press act as if there may be a major scandal brewing? Because the administration fears, and the press suspects, that the latest revelations in the Enron affair will raise the lid on crony capitalism, American style.<br/><br/>Cronyism is hardly novel in America; the Clinton administration took us to the edge of a trade war on behalf of Chiquita bananas, a major campaign contributor. But the Bush administration, with its sense of entitlement, seems unconcerned by even the most blatant conflicts of interest like the plan of Marc Racicot, the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, to continue drawing a seven-figure salary as a lobbyist. (He now says he won''t lobby - but he will still receive that salary.)<br/><br/>The real questions about Enron''s relationship with the administration involve what happened before the energy trader hit the skids. That''s when Mr Lay allegedly told the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that he should be more cooperative if he wanted to keep his job. (He wasn''t, and he didn''t.) And it''s when Enron helped Dick Cheney devise an energy plan that certainly looks as if it was written by and for the companies that advised his task force. Mr Cheney, in clear defiance of the law, has refused to release any information about his task force''s deliberations; what is he hiding?<br/><br/>And while Enron has imploded, other energy companies retain the administration''s ear. Just daysbefore the latest Enron revelations, the administration signalled its intention to weaken pollution rules on power plants; lately it announced its decision to proceed with a controversial plan to store radioactive waste in Nevada. Each of these decisions was worth billions to companies with very strong connections to Mr. Bush. CBSMarketWatch.com declared, in its story about the nuclear waste decision. that ''one group of major energy-business political donors just hit the jackpot''. Notice the source of that quote. In recent months, while political reporters have been busy waving the flag, business reporters have taken the lead intelling us what''s really going on. And they seem disgusted by what they see. It was CBSMarketWatch''s executive editor, not some whining political commentator, who warned that ''a small group of business leaders exert enormous clout over Bush and his team in getting the rules changed to their benefit''.<br/><br/>And the business magazine Red Herring has published the biggest expose to date of the secretive Carlyle Group, an investment company whose story sounds like the plot of a bad TV series. Carlyle specializes in buying down-and-out defence contractors, then reselling them when their fortunes miraculously improve after they receive new government business. Among the company''s employees is former President George H. W. Bush. Among the group''s investors, until late October, was the Bin Laden family of Saudi Arabia.<br/><br/>Another administration would have regarded the elder Bush''s role at Carlyle as unseemly; this administration apparently does not. And defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld recently gave his old college wrestling partner Frank Carlucci, head of Carlyle, a very nice gift: Mr Rumsfeld decided to proceed with the much- criticized Crusader artillery system, which even the Pentagon wanted to cancel. The result was another turnaround for a Carlyle-owned company.<br/><br/>Sad to say, none of this is clearly illegal - it just stinks to high heaven.

And why does the press act as if there may be a major scandal brewing? Because the administration fears, and the press suspects, that the latest revelations in the Enron affair will raise the lid on crony capitalism, American style.<br/><br/>Cronyism is hardly novel in America; the Clinton administration took us to the edge of a trade war on behalf of Chiquita bananas, a major campaign contributor. But the Bush administration, with its sense of entitlement, seems unconcerned by even the most blatant conflicts of interest like the plan of Marc Racicot, the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, to continue drawing a seven-figure salary as a lobbyist. (He now says he won''t lobby - but he will still receive that salary.)<br/><br/>The real questions about Enron''s relationship with the administration involve what happened before the energy trader hit the skids. That''s when Mr Lay allegedly told the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that he should be more cooperative if he wanted to keep his job. (He wasn''t, and he didn''t.) And it''s when Enron helped Dick Cheney devise an energy plan that certainly looks as if it was written by and for the companies that advised his task force. Mr Cheney, in clear defiance of the law, has refused to release any information about his task force''s deliberations; what is he hiding?<br/><br/>And while Enron has imploded, other energy companies retain the administration''s ear. Just daysbefore the latest Enron revelations, the administration signalled its intention to weaken pollution rules on power plants; lately it announced its decision to proceed with a controversial plan to store radioactive waste in Nevada. Each of these decisions was worth billions to companies with very strong connections to Mr. Bush. CBSMarketWatch.com declared, in its story about the nuclear waste decision. that ''one group of major energy-business political donors just hit the jackpot''. Notice the source of that quote. In recent months, while political reporters have been busy waving the flag, business reporters have taken the lead intelling us what''s really going on. And they seem disgusted by what they see. It was CBSMarketWatch''s executive editor, not some whining political commentator, who warned that ''a small group of business leaders exert enormous clout over Bush and his team in getting the rules changed to their benefit''.<br/><br/>And the business magazine Red Herring has published the biggest expose to date of the secretive Carlyle Group, an investment company whose story sounds like the plot of a bad TV series. Carlyle specializes in buying down-and-out defence contractors, then reselling them when their fortunes miraculously improve after they receive new government business. Among the company''s employees is former President George H. W. Bush. Among the group''s investors, until late October, was the Bin Laden family of Saudi Arabia.<br/><br/>Another administration would have regarded the elder Bush''s role at Carlyle as unseemly; this administration apparently does not. And defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld recently gave his old college wrestling partner Frank Carlucci, head of Carlyle, a very nice gift: Mr Rumsfeld decided to proceed with the much- criticized Crusader artillery system, which even the Pentagon wanted to cancel. The result was another turnaround for a Carlyle-owned company.<br/><br/>Sad to say, none of this is clearly illegal - it just stinks to high heaven. That''s why the Bush administration will try to keep the Enron story narrowly focused on one company during its death throes. Just remember that the real story is much bigger.<br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[1]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[Which of these is a feature of the genuine musical?<br/>A.

And the fifth, while strictly not a musical, deals with fictionalized stories about singers, bands, and the music industry A Hard Day''s Night, / Wanna Hold Your Hand, Fame, The Commitments, Georgia, Grace of My Heart, That Thing You Do and Centerstage. The old musicals are the only good musicals. False. Contemporary musicals, often underrated, have their own charm. Though it is true that in Hollywood, the musical, like the western, is dying.

AR and SK have vowed never to work together in a film. Also PZ has not yet worked with VO.<br/>2. Among the four established actress, AK only works with RM.<br/>3. All of SRK''s hits in the past 5 years have been with only two actresses.<br/>4. VO only works with established actresses.<br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[3]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[1. If AK only works with RM, than 2003 hit of AK is with RM.<br/>2. Hence SRK in 2003 combined with PZ to give a hit<br/>3. If AR and SK do not work together, then AR''s two hits in 2000 are with SRK and VO.<br/>4. Hence SK''s hit in 2000 is with RM.<br/>5. SRK has had hits with PZ and AR in 2003 and 2000 respectively. So SRK''s hits in 2002 are with PZ and AR. Also SRK''s in 2004 is with AR.<br/>6. VO''s 2004 hit is with MD.<br/>7. As VO has had 2 hits in 2001, atleast one of them is with MD. Given that PZ has not worked with VO, then VO''s 2nd  hit in 2001 is with RM.<br/>8. Hence in 2001, PZ has a hit with HR<br/><br/>The 2 hits of others in 2004 are with HR and SK, and the three hits in 2002 are with AK, HR and SK. Hence both HR and SK have had 2 hits with others.

Now research into the origins of this tale shows that it was actually a critique of the banking establishment in the Ulted States of America and perhaps an early example of monetary activism in the 20th century.<br/><br/>Most of us usually don''t stop to wonder about the basic nature or function of money. We may lament the unequal distribution of money in society and how it can corrupt human behaviour. However, it seems difficult to imagine that the functions of money could be moulded in ways that would solve many social and economic problems.<br/><br/>Yet this is just what a wide range of activists are doing today. They are remindingus, first, that money is not the same as wealth. For money itself can neither be eaten, nor worn nor lived in for shelter. Second, such activists are working out monetary systems that simultaneously nurture community life, help restore ecological balance and provide employment.<br/><br/>At the dawn of human civilization all wealth was equated with tangible useful things. For example, the word ''capital'' did not originally mean money. The word is derived from the Latin word capitis, which means head and it referred to heads of cattle. In ancient Egypt the monetary system was based on stockpiles of grains. Till about 200 years ago wealth was stored mainly in land and its improvements.<br/><br/>Money, unlike cattle or grain, does not exist in nature. It is an abstract institution of society, a medium of exchange, invented about 3,000 years ago to facilitate trade. In some societies money took the form of stones and shells. By about AD 1000 coins made of precious and semi-precious metals were known all over the world.<br/><br/>Subsequently, paper money was introduced when private banks made loans. In the 20th century, the supply of this paper money came to be regulated by the Central Bank of each country.Till about 20 years ago, paper money was backed by gold. Today there is nothing material backing the world''s currencies and yet they exercise a position of supreme power. The consequence is that money in the bank is equated with wealth, rather than tangibles like natural resources that actually sustain life.<br/><br/>Take for instance the following logic offered by a Malaysian minister for forestry to David Korten, author of the book The Post Corporate World. Korten, who is also co-founder of the People-Centered Development Forum in the US, narrates how the Malaysian observed that his country would be better oft once its forests were cleared away and the money from the sale was stashed in banks earning interest. The financial returns would be greater. The image flashed through my mind of a barren and lifeless world populated only by banks with their computers faithfully and endlessly compounding the interest on the profits from timber sales.<br/><br/>The Malaysian Minister''s views are based on the fact that in the global economy, money is indeed growing faster than trees. This is because the global monetary system has got virtually de-linked from the real economy In 1995, the global daily exchange of currency was $1.3 trillion, that is 30 times more than the daily gross domestic product (GDP) of all the developed countries.Thus, writer-activists like Korten say that we are all victims of the war of money against life. The consequences of this are rapid depletion of real wealth, that is natural resources, and concentration of money in the hands of a few. The world''s 450 billionaires are estimated to have combined financial assets that are greater than the combined annual incomes of half of humanity.<br/><br/>Money is like an iron ring we''ve put through our noses. We''ve forgotten that we designed it, and it''s now leading us around, says Bemard Lietaer, a former banker and BOW activist-academic based at the University of California, Berkeley. It is time, urges Lietaer, to design a money system that takes us towards sustainability and community: Lietaer is a Belgian who years ago helped to design the single European currency system and is now one of the leading champions of alternative community-based currencies. The Future of Money:Beyond Greed and Scarcity, the title of Lietaer''s latest book, conveys the essence of today''s monetary activism. This is one of several books that have recently been published, in the US and the UK, on how the existing money system needs to be, and can be reinvented. These include The Ecology of Money and Short Circuit, by the Irish economist Richard Douthwaite, and Time Dollars by Edgar Cahn and Jonathan Rowe. The Schumacher Society in both the US and UK, the New Economics Foundation in the UK, the American Monetary Institute and Transaction Net in the US. are among the groups spearheading such efforts.<br/><br/>Political activism to challenge the capitalist monetary system is not new. Even a hundred years ago, in the US, there was strong political mobilization against monetary policies that favoured the rich at the cost of farmers and workers. Frank Baum, the author of Wizard of Oz, was a staunch supporter of one of these movements. The History of Money, a book by the anthropologist Jack Weatherford tells of how Baum''s title is actually an attack on the established banking system that deliberately kept money in short supply. Scarcity is one of the key problems of the current form of money.<br/><br/>Money has different effects depending on its origins and the purpose it is intended to serve. Money created to make profits for a commercial bank is intended to remain scarce and has an entirely different effect compared with a local currency created by the users themselves purely to facilitate their trade. Monetary activists are calling for decreasing the hold of scarce currencies and strengthening sufficient currencies — that is, those created within communities by mutual credit systems.<br/><br/>The fundamental premise of all this work is that in a healthy economy, money is neither the dominant value nor the sole or even dominant medium of exchange. Money must be a servant of the creation and protection of real wealth.<br/><br/>This is clearly not a call for boycotting the conventional national currencies. Local currencies are intended to serve a supplementary function. In extremely successful situations, these currencies do significantly lessen people''s dependence on the conventional currency issued by banks and governments.<br/><br/>The other powerful instrument of a healthy monetary system is zero or negative interest money. The idea of negative interest or a demurrage charge is based on the premise that money is a public good, like the telephone or bus transport and that we should charge a small fee for using it. Under such a system, money would be used only as a medium of exchange, not as a store for value. Since this would encourage circulation it would help to create more work and livelihoods.<br/><br/>Lietaer forecasts that different forms of alternative currencies will be a major tool for social design in the 21 St century, primarily because they will be conducive to higher levels of employment. ''I propose that we choose to develop money systems that will enable us to attain sustainability and community healing on a local and global scale. These objectives are in our grasp within less than one generation''s time. Whether we materialize them or not will depend on our capacity to cooperate with each other to consciously reinvent our money'' says Lietaer.<br/><br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[1]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[According to the activists, why is money not the same as wealth?]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[Money does not nurture community life, help restore ecological balance and provide employment like wealth.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Because it is concentrated in the hands of only a few.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Because capital originally did not mean money.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Money is only a medium of exchange whereas wealth is equated with tangibles like natural resources that actually sustain life.]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section III - Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[PASSAGE - I<br/><br/>The American fairy tale, Wizard of Oz, is commonly known as the struggle of a bunch of simple people against some wicked witches and wizards.

These include The Ecology of Money and Short Circuit, by the Irish economist Richard Douthwaite, and Time Dollars by Edgar Cahn and Jonathan Rowe. The Schumacher Society in both the US and UK, the New Economics Foundation in the UK, the American Monetary Institute and Transaction Net in the US. are among the groups spearheading such efforts.<br/><br/>Political activism to challenge the capitalist monetary system is not new. Even a hundred years ago, in the US, there was strong political mobilization against monetary policies that favoured the rich at the cost of farmers and workers. Frank Baum, the author of Wizard of Oz, was a staunch supporter of one of these movements. The History of Money, a book by the anthropologist Jack Weatherford tells of how Baum''s title is actually an attack on the established banking system that deliberately kept money in short supply. Scarcity is one of the key problems of the current form of money.<br/><br/>Money has different effects depending on its origins and the purpose it is intended to serve. Money created to make profits for a commercial bank is intended to remain scarce and has an entirely different effect compared with a local currency created by the users themselves purely to facilitate their trade. Monetary activists are calling for decreasing the hold of scarce currencies and strengthening sufficient currencies — that is, those created within communities by mutual credit systems.<br/><br/>The fundamental premise of all this work is that in a healthy economy, money is neither the dominant value nor the sole or even dominant medium of exchange. Money must be a servant of the creation and protection of real wealth.<br/><br/>This is clearly not a call for boycotting the conventional national currencies. Local currencies are intended to serve a supplementary function. In extremely successful situations, these currencies do significantly lessen people''s dependence on the conventional currency issued by banks and governments.<br/><br/>The other powerful instrument of a healthy monetary system is zero or negative interest money. The idea of negative interest or a demurrage charge is based on the premise that money is a public good, like the telephone or bus transport and that we should charge a small fee for using it. Under such a system, money would be used only as a medium of exchange, not as a store for value. Since this would encourage circulation it would help to create more work and livelihoods.<br/><br/>Lietaer forecasts that different forms of alternative currencies will be a major tool for social design in the 21 St century, primarily because they will be conducive to higher levels of employment. ''I propose that we choose to develop money systems that will enable us to attain sustainability and community healing on a local and global scale. These objectives are in our grasp within less than one generation''s time.

But music-making happens if temperaments and bio-rhythms are in tune, whereas the Brazilian conductor and the Italian players — like footballers from two traditionally opposed teams —just could not play in harmony. In Rio, things got so bad that the conductor was dismissed. His replacement, another local, did not work out either. So, in desperation, the Italian orchestra handed the baton over to its own principal cellist.<br/><br/>This cellist proved a sensational conductor. He did not conduct by looking at the printed score because, it seemed, he knew every singer''s part in the opera by heart. Subsequently, it transpired he had memorized all 12 operas in the company''s repertoire, and in later years it became apparent that he could retain inside his head whole symphonies, concertos, and every other piece of music he was asked to conduct. Was this the reincarnation of Wolfgang Amadeus? Well, not quite, but a name (phonetically close to Mozart), ''Maestro'', came to be attached to him (and is now used in connection with all orchestra conductors). This first Maestro was Arturo Toscanini, whose (manically un-romantic interpretations of music inaugurated a new tradition of interpretive austerity.<br/><br/>If Mahatma Gandhi had a moral counterpart in Western music, it was Toscanini. An almost exact contemporary of the Mahatma, Toscanini wielded a baton to captivate the classical music world as profoundly and as singularly and over the same stretch of time — as Gandhi symbolically used his walking stick to orchestrate the Indian peasantry. If Gandhi knew that his god-given mission was to oppose colonial rule, Toscanini knew he had inherited the spirit of Beethoven and was God''s messiah in republican ltaly''s fight against Mussolini.<br/><br/>Artists, musicians, and intellectuals who exist within politically intolerant states always face hard choices, because such states are usually too insecure to ignore them. The artistically eminent are either hounded out or forced to compromise. In late years they seem heroic or supine depending upon the nature of their dealings with political authority. In European literature there is even a Goethean myth of the Faustian artist who, surpassing compromise, sells his soul to the devil in return for absolute artistic power. In a God-centred world, this artistic sell-out is to Mephistopheles — for example, in Marlowe''s Doctor Faustus or Thomas Mann''s novel of the same name.<br/><br/>In a man-centred world, the devil''s equivalent becomes the political tyrant: Mephistopheles becomes Mussolini. Mussolini and his clones, such as Hitler and Stalin, Milosevic and Modi, relish wiping out entire populations, and to keep their genocide going they require the support of artists, intellectuals, and the local media, a requirement which the artists themselves sometimes brilliantly depict in art. Istvan Szabo''s film Mephistoand Francois Truffaut''s The LastMetro dramatize this conflict between the artist, struggling to keep his art going, and tyranny, which demands subservience with jackboots. In Stalinist Russia, the lives of Boris Pasternak and Dmitry Shosakovich reveal this struggle. In Nazi Germany, the best-known musical collaborators were Wilhelm Furtwangier and his celebrity successor Herbert von Karajan. They contrast with the two Jewish conductors who resisted Hitler, Otto Klemperer and Bruno Walter. In Fascist Italy, the same contrast exists between Toscanini and the capitulating opera composer Mascagni.<br/><br/>Toscanini is Western classical music''s example of the un-Faustian artist who will not be cowed down, who resists bayonet with baton. He was the most charismatic, the most fiercely Republican, the most fanatically anti-Fascist conductor of the 20th Century. If his mnemonic capacities reminded people of Mozart, his public hatred of monarchists reminded people of Beethoven. How did Toscanini resist Mussolini? First, by refusing to play ''Giovinezza'', the Fascist anthem, as part of his Concerts despite Mussolini''s repeated threats. Second, by making known his opposition to Fascism through the media and gossip networks. Third, by leaving Italy rather than agreeing to stage concerts implicitly celebrating Fascism and ''El Duce''. Finally, by consistently supporting deserving Jewish musicians.<br/><br/>Toscanini''s name is not one you''d connect with a football fanatic — even though this democrat-Maestro''s relationship with his own players, paradoxically, was so dictatorial that they felt as kicked around as footballs. But no, the connection between Toscanini and football, in this case, is the soccer journalist Brian Glanville, who, like the American sports-writer Paul Gallico before him, also writes novels. Glanville''s most recent novel is titled Dictators. It tells the fascinating story of Toscanini''s successful ideological opposition to Mussolini, a story in which the most dictatorial conductor of all times overcomes the prototype of Fascism via evasive and prolonged guerrilla tactics.<br/><br/>Glanville''s novel is not very novelish, however. It schematically deploys a fictional framework to speculate on Toscanini''s hatred of Mussolini and the latter''s fascination with the conductor. But if one thinks of the book as a historical exploration rather than a novel, it manages to enliven Fascist Italy while hitting several nails on the head. Glanville recognizes, for instance, the analogy between a conductor who marshals a small band towards the creation of a larger entity, namely the symphony, and a political leader who orchestrates a population towards the creation of a larger entity, namely the nation. At one point rn the novel Mussolini says to Toscanini: "You may be a great conductor, Toscanini, but I''m an artist too! You only conduct an orchestra: I control the masses like an artist!" Glanville recognizes, equally, the radical difference between Toscanini''s dictatorship and Mussolini''s, revealing the one as dictating in favour of democracy, the other in favour of racism.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is no necessary connection between musical and artistic worth on the one hand and political sanity on the other. Richard Wagner, T. S. Eliot, V. S. Naipaul and Philip Larkin are colossal nasties on the political scale, but they''re artistically on the same scale as Giuseppi Verdi, Bertrand Russell, E. M. Forster and George Orwell. All the same, it does feel very nice when one comes across a great artist who is not an utter swine politically. Glanville''s novel is worth reading if only for this reason. It shows a wonderful musician in the guise of a dictator, battling and winning against the foulest political animal of his time.<br/><br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[2]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[According to the author, Toscanini is un-Faustian because]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[he refused to compromise his integrity for artistic success.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[he was anti-fascist.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[he resisted Mussolini.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[he was artistically very eminent.]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section III - Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[PASSAGE - II<br/><br/><br/>In 1886, a small Italian opera company went on a tour of South America under a Brazilian conductor who, it was hoped, would boost the size of their audiences.

But music-making happens if temperaments and bio-rhythms are in tune, whereas the Brazilian conductor and the Italian players — like footballers from two traditionally opposed teams —just could not play in harmony. In Rio, things got so bad that the conductor was dismissed. His replacement, another local, did not work out either. So, in desperation, the Italian orchestra handed the baton over to its own principal cellist.<br/><br/>This cellist proved a sensational conductor. He did not conduct by looking at the printed score because, it seemed, he knew every singer''s part in the opera by heart. Subsequently, it transpired he had memorized all 12 operas in the company''s repertoire, and in later years it became apparent that he could retain inside his head whole symphonies, concertos, and every other piece of music he was asked to conduct. Was this the reincarnation of Wolfgang Amadeus? Well, not quite, but a name (phonetically close to Mozart), ''Maestro'', came to be attached to him (and is now used in connection with all orchestra conductors). This first Maestro was Arturo Toscanini, whose (manically un-romantic interpretations of music inaugurated a new tradition of interpretive austerity.<br/><br/>If Mahatma Gandhi had a moral counterpart in Western music, it was Toscanini. An almost exact contemporary of the Mahatma, Toscanini wielded a baton to captivate the classical music world as profoundly and as singularly and over the same stretch of time — as Gandhi symbolically used his walking stick to orchestrate the Indian peasantry. If Gandhi knew that his god-given mission was to oppose colonial rule, Toscanini knew he had inherited the spirit of Beethoven and was God''s messiah in republican ltaly''s fight against Mussolini.<br/><br/>Artists, musicians, and intellectuals who exist within politically intolerant states always face hard choices, because such states are usually too insecure to ignore them. The artistically eminent are either hounded out or forced to compromise. In late years they seem heroic or supine depending upon the nature of their dealings with political authority. In European literature there is even a Goethean myth of the Faustian artist who, surpassing compromise, sells his soul to the devil in return for absolute artistic power. In a God-centred world, this artistic sell-out is to Mephistopheles — for example, in Marlowe''s Doctor Faustus or Thomas Mann''s novel of the same name.<br/><br/>In a man-centred world, the devil''s equivalent becomes the political tyrant: Mephistopheles becomes Mussolini. Mussolini and his clones, such as Hitler and Stalin, Milosevic and Modi, relish wiping out entire populations, and to keep their genocide going they require the support of artists, intellectuals, and the local media, a requirement which the artists themselves sometimes brilliantly depict in art. Istvan Szabo''s film Mephistoand Francois Truffaut''s The LastMetro dramatize this conflict between the artist, struggling to keep his art going, and tyranny, which demands subservience with jackboots. In Stalinist Russia, the lives of Boris Pasternak and Dmitry Shosakovich reveal this struggle. In Nazi Germany, the best-known musical collaborators were Wilhelm Furtwangier and his celebrity successor Herbert von Karajan. They contrast with the two Jewish conductors who resisted Hitler, Otto Klemperer and Bruno Walter. In Fascist Italy, the same contrast exists between Toscanini and the capitulating opera composer Mascagni.<br/><br/>Toscanini is Western classical music''s example of the un-Faustian artist who will not be cowed down, who resists bayonet with baton. He was the most charismatic, the most fiercely Republican, the most fanatically anti-Fascist conductor of the 20th Century. If his mnemonic capacities reminded people of Mozart, his public hatred of monarchists reminded people of Beethoven. How did Toscanini resist Mussolini? First, by refusing to play ''Giovinezza'', the Fascist anthem, as part of his Concerts despite Mussolini''s repeated threats. Second, by making known his opposition to Fascism through the media and gossip networks. Third, by leaving Italy rather than agreeing to stage concerts implicitly celebrating Fascism and ''El Duce''. Finally, by consistently supporting deserving Jewish musicians.<br/><br/>Toscanini''s name is not one you''d connect with a football fanatic — even though this democrat-Maestro''s relationship with his own players, paradoxically, was so dictatorial that they felt as kicked around as footballs. But no, the connection between Toscanini and football, in this case, is the soccer journalist Brian Glanville, who, like the American sports-writer Paul Gallico before him, also writes novels. Glanville''s most recent novel is titled Dictators. It tells the fascinating story of Toscanini''s successful ideological opposition to Mussolini, a story in which the most dictatorial conductor of all times overcomes the prototype of Fascism via evasive and prolonged guerrilla tactics.<br/><br/>Glanville''s novel is not very novelish, however.

Our closest planetary neighbour in the solar system offers a tantalizing glimpse of humanity''s future and promises to be our first step onto another world. The first human mission to Mars could soon be underway and brave astronauts will once again venture into the unknown in a quest to further knowledge about the origin of life and the universe. But at what cost?<br/><br/>The most obvious and immediate threat to astronauts'' lives dunng any space mission comes from accidents, evident from the Challenger and Columbia disasters in 1986 and 2003. The level of radiation to which a crew is exposed is also of great concern and has been described as the primary source of hazard for interplanetary space flight. A mission to Mars could expose crews to 100 times the radiation levels experienced during a Shuttle mission and 1000 times that during a year on Earth.<br/><br/>Less apparent are the changes to physiological systems, which are directly associated with the unique microgravity environment of space, including loss of bone and muscle mass, cardiovascular deconditioning and impaired immune function. The level of physiological degradation from radiation and change in gravity, during a round trip to Mars could be so severe that the first human mission could be a one-way trip; crews may be too weak or ill to re-enter Earth''s'' atmosphere. So should astronauts embark on a journey to the ''red planet'' knowing that they may never return to Earth?<br/><br/>Supporters of a Mars mission argue that the same degradation which causes health problems during space flight can be used to achieve scientific and medical breakthroughs. John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962, and who, at the.age of 77, became the oldest man to enter space, refers to notable parallels between the effects of microgravity on astronauts and the ageing process on terra firma. Many health problems that affect the aged — loss of bone density, breakdowns in immune response and cardiovascular deconditioning — also affect young, healthy astronauts once they enter microgravity. This process occurs far quicker, however, allowing studies to be undertaken over shorter periods. Finding out what triggers these adaptations and developing suitable countermeasures may enable the treatment of diseases, such as osteoporosis, on Earth.<br/><br/>The incredible costs involved with any mission into space — approximately US $500 million for every Shuttle launch — have been used to question the appropriateness of the venture, with some scientists suggesting that it would be better to invest resources in additional robotic missions. Robots, it can be argued, allow the same level of investigation to be achieved at a fraction of the cost and without risking human life. This has been heightened by NASA estimating the cost of a human Mars programme could be an extraordinary US $55 billion. Other concerns relate to current problems on Earth, such as pollution, famine and war, with many arguing these should be resolved before embarking on any further exploration of the solar system. The pollution debate becomes most apparent when considering the process required to make Mars more Earth-like, termed ''Terraforming''. Terraforming is based on the idea that by heating the polar ice caps of Mars the carbon-dioxide contained within them will be released, creating a greenhouse effect on the planet.<br/><br/>With people living in space for even longer periods the need to regulate them becomes more apparent. Human interaction issues, such as conflict, will be of particular concern. Problems regarding ownership, space law and justice have led to the development of space law institutes, professors of space law and even law journals devoted to extraterrestrial affairs. In 1967 the United Nation''s Outer Space Treaty was drawn up preventing anyone claiming ownership of the Moon. Will the same be true for Mars and the rest of the solar system?<br/><br/>The most important long-term reason for exploring Mars and beyond is that every planetary society is endangered by impacts from space, as the Earth itself was in 1996 from Asteroid JA1 and will undoubtedly be again in the future. Every surviving civilization is obliged to become spacefaring for the most practical reason imaginable — staying alive. It can be argued, therefore, that to explore is not only part of the human spirit but, more pragmatically, that exploration is the key to our long-term survival. <br/><br/>The biggest obstacle remains preserving human health, particularly protecting the body from radiation exposure and physiological degradation. Since Yuri Gagarin became the first human to enter space, over 40 years ago, more than 400 pioneers have ventured into the hazardous environment. Astronauts and cosmonauts are well aware of the dangers space flight presents but many state they would still venture to Mars even if they might never return. Like test fighter pilots they acknowledge the risks they face with each flight, seeing themselves as pioneers ''pushing the human envelope''.<br/><br/>For those who find a human mission to Mars difficult to comprehend it is interesting to look back to the year 1903 before the Wright brothers had achieved the first human flight, the atom had been split, and Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aidrin had walked on the Moon.<br/><br/>Achieving the interplanetary goal of reaching Mars is more than simply one of aerospace accomplishment. It will reaffirm the pioneering character of human society; something that many believe has diminished since the Moon landings of the sixties and seventies. We will venture to the red planet this century, in the name of science and survival, but also for reasons of human achievement and endeavour. This philosophy is best summed up by the words of President John F. Kennedy when announcing plans for the Apollo Moon missions: "We choose to go the Moon... and do the other things, not because they are easy but because they are hard."<br/><br/>The International Space Station will undoubtedly be a very high-risk venture. Even greater risks (and rewards) of living on the Moon and travelling to Mars are likely to follow. Throughout history, visionaries and explorers have been willing to take up such challenges. Surely there are no better justifications for space travel than the furthering of human knowledge, the uplifting of human spirit and the redefining of our relationship with the rest of the universe.<br/><br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[4]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[Which of these is not a reason why people want to travel to Mars?]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[To achieve scientific and medical breakthroughs.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Because it will be an aerospace accomplishment.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Because it is difficult to achieve.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[To be like the Wright brothers and Neil Armstrong.]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section III - Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[PASSAGE - III<br/><br/><br/>Mars has always fascinated humankind and its red glow has k''ept an unshakeable grip on human imagination for thousands of years.

Our closest planetary neighbour in the solar system offers a tantalizing glimpse of humanity''s future and promises to be our first step onto another world. The first human mission to Mars could soon be underway and brave astronauts will once again venture into the unknown in a quest to further knowledge about the origin of life and the universe.

The level of radiation to which a crew is exposed is also of great concern and has been described as the primary source of hazard for interplanetary space flight. A mission to Mars could expose crews to 100 times the radiation levels experienced during a Shuttle mission and 1000 times that during a year on Earth.<br/><br/>Less apparent are the changes to physiological systems, which are directly associated with the unique microgravity environment of space, including loss of bone and muscle mass, cardiovascular deconditioning and impaired immune function. The level of physiological degradation from radiation and change in gravity, during a round trip to Mars could be so severe that the first human mission could be a one-way trip; crews may be too weak or ill to re-enter Earth''s'' atmosphere. So should astronauts embark on a journey to the ''red planet'' knowing that they may never return to Earth?<br/><br/>Supporters of a Mars mission argue that the same degradation which causes health problems during space flight can be used to achieve scientific and medical breakthroughs. John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962, and who, at the.age of 77, became the oldest man to enter space, refers to notable parallels between the effects of microgravity on astronauts and the ageing process on terra firma.

This process occurs far quicker, however, allowing studies to be undertaken over shorter periods. Finding out what triggers these adaptations and developing suitable countermeasures may enable the treatment of diseases, such as osteoporosis, on Earth.<br/><br/>The incredible costs involved with any mission into space — approximately US $500 million for every Shuttle launch — have been used to question the appropriateness of the venture, with some scientists suggesting that it would be better to invest resources in additional robotic missions. Robots, it can be argued, allow the same level of investigation to be achieved at a fraction of the cost and without risking human life. This has been heightened by NASA estimating the cost of a human Mars programme could be an extraordinary US $55 billion. Other concerns relate to current problems on Earth, such as pollution, famine and war, with many arguing these should be resolved before embarking on any further exploration of the solar system. The pollution debate becomes most apparent when considering the process required to make Mars more Earth-like, termed ''Terraforming''. Terraforming is based on the idea that by heating the polar ice caps of Mars the carbon-dioxide contained within them will be released, creating a greenhouse effect on the planet.<br/><br/>With people living in space for even longer periods the need to regulate them becomes more apparent. Human interaction issues, such as conflict, will be of particular concern. Problems regarding ownership, space law and justice have led to the development of space law institutes, professors of space law and even law journals devoted to extraterrestrial affairs. In 1967 the United Nation''s Outer Space Treaty was drawn up preventing anyone claiming ownership of the Moon. Will the same be true for Mars and the rest of the solar system?<br/><br/>The most important long-term reason for exploring Mars and beyond is that every planetary society is endangered by impacts from space, as the Earth itself was in 1996 from Asteroid JA1 and will undoubtedly be again in the future. Every surviving civilization is obliged to become spacefaring for the most practical reason imaginable — staying alive. It can be argued, therefore, that to explore is not only part of the human spirit but, more pragmatically, that exploration is the key to our long-term survival. <br/><br/>The biggest obstacle remains preserving human health, particularly protecting the body from radiation exposure and physiological degradation. Since Yuri Gagarin became the first human to enter space, over 40 years ago, more than 400 pioneers have ventured into the hazardous environment. Astronauts and cosmonauts are well aware of the dangers space flight presents but many state they would still venture to Mars even if they might never return. Like test fighter pilots they acknowledge the risks they face with each flight, seeing themselves as pioneers ''pushing the human envelope''.<br/><br/>For those who find a human mission to Mars difficult to comprehend it is interesting to look back to the year 1903 before the Wright brothers had achieved the first human flight, the atom had been split, and Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aidrin had walked on the Moon.<br/><br/>Achieving the interplanetary goal of reaching Mars is more than simply one of aerospace accomplishment. It will reaffirm the pioneering character of human society; something that many believe has diminished since the Moon landings of the sixties and seventies. We will venture to the red planet this century, in the name of science and survival, but also for reasons of human achievement and endeavour. This philosophy is best summed up by the words of President John F. Kennedy when announcing plans for the Apollo Moon missions: "We choose to go the Moon... and do the other things, not because they are easy but because they are hard."<br/><br/>The International Space Station will undoubtedly be a very high-risk venture. Even greater risks (and rewards) of living on the Moon and travelling to Mars are likely to follow. Throughout history, visionaries and explorers have been willing to take up such challenges. Surely there are no better justifications for space travel than the furthering of human knowledge, the uplifting of human spirit and the redefining of our relationship with the rest of the universe.<br/><br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[2]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[<br/>1.

Last month, the Council of Europe''s parliamentary assembly voted to condemn the "crimes of totalitarian communist regimes," linking them with Nazism and complaining that communist parties are still "legal and active in some countries." Now Goran Lindblad, the conservative Swedish MP behind the resolution, wants to go further. Demands that European Ministers launch a continent-wide anti-communist campaign - including school textbook revisions, official memorial days, and museums - only narrowly missed the necessary two-thirds majority. Mr. Lindblad pledged to bring the wider plans back to the Council of Europe in the coming months.<br/><br/>He has chosen a good year for his ideological offensive: this is the 50th anniversary of Nikita Khrushchev''s denunciation of Josef Stalin and the subsequent Hungarian uprising, which will doubtless be the cue for further excoriation of the communist record. Paradoxically, given that there is no communist government left in Europe outside Moldova, the attacks have if anything, become more extreme as time has gone on. A clue as to why that might be can be found in the rambling report by Mr. Lindblad that led to the Council of Europe declaration. Blaming class struggle and public ownership, he explained "different elements of communist ideology such as equality or social justice still seduce many" and "a sort of nostalgia for communism is still alive." Perhaps the real problem for Mr. Lindblad and his right-wing allies in Eastern Europe is that communism is not dead enough - and they will only be content when they have driven a stake through its heart.<br/><br/>The fashionable attempt to equate communism and Nazism is in reality a moral and historical nonsense. Despite the cruelties of the Stalin terror, there was no Soviet Treblinka or Sorbibor, no extermination camps built to murder millions. Nor did the Soviet Union launch the most devastating war in history at a cost of more than 50 million lives - in fact it played the decisive role in the defeat of the German war machine. Mr. Lindblad and the Council of Europe adopt as fact the wildest estimates of those "killed by communist regimes" (mostly in famines) from the fiercely contested Black Book of Communism, which also underplays the number of deaths attributable to Hitler. But, in any case, none of this explains why anyone might be nostalgic in former communist states, now enjoying the delights of capitalist restoration. The dominant account gives no sense of how communist regimes renewed themselves after 1956 or why Western leaders feared they might overtake the capitalist world well into the 1960s. For all its brutalities and failures, communism in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere delivered rapid industrialization, mass education, job security, and huge advances in social and gender equality. Its existence helped to drive up welfare standards in the West, and provided a powerful counterweight to Western global domination.<br/><br/>It would be easier to take the Council of Europe''s condemnation of communist state crimes seriously if it had also seen fit to denounce the far bloodier record of European colonialism - which only finally came to an end in the 1970s. This was a system of racist despotism, which dominated the globe in Stalin''s time. And while there is precious little connection between the ideas of fascism and communism, there is an intimate link between colonialism and Nazism. The terms lebensraum and konzentrationslager were both first used by the German colonial regime in south-west Africa (now Namibia), which committed genocide against the Herero and Nama peoples and bequeathed its ideas and personnel directly to the Nazi party.<br/><br/>Around 10 million Congolese died as a result of Belgian forced labour and mass murder in the early twentieth century; tens of millions perished in avoidable or enforced famines in British-ruled India; up to a million Algerians died in their war for independence, while controversy now rages in France about a new law requiring teachers to put a positive spin on colonial history. Comparable atrocities were earned out by all european colonialists, but not a word of condemnation from the Council of Europe. Presumably, European lives count for more.<br/><br/> No major twentieth century political tradition is without blood on its hands, but battles over history are more about the future than the past. Part of the current enthusiasm in official Western circles for dancing on the grave of communism is no doubt about relations with today''s Russia and China. But it also reflects a determination to prove there is no alternative to the new global capitalist order - and that any attempt to find one is bound to lead to suffering. With the new imperialism now being resisted in the Muslim world and Latin America, growing international demands for social justice and ever greater doubts about whether the environmental crisis can be solved within the existing economic system, the pressure for alternatives will increase.<br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[3]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[What, according to the author, is the real reason for a renewed attack against communism?]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[Disguising the unintended consequences of the current economic order such as social injustice and environmental crisis.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Idealising the existing ideology of global capitalism.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Making communism a generic representative of all historical atrocities, especially those perpetrated by the European imperialists.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Communism still survives, in bits and pieces, in the minds and hearts of people.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Renewal of some communist regimes has led to the apprehension that communist nations might overtake the capitalists.]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section II - Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[Directions for Questions 36 to 40: <br/><br/>The passage given below is followed by a set of five questions.

With the new imperialism now being resisted in the Muslim world and Latin America, growing international demands for social justice and ever greater doubts about whether the environmental crisis can be solved within the existing economic system, the pressure for alternatives will increase.<br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[4]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[A just society, as conceptualized in the passage, can be best described as:]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[A Utopia in which everyone is equal and no one enjoys any privilege based on their existing positions and powers.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[A hypothetical society in which people agree upon principles of justice which are fair.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[A society in which principles of justice are not based on the existing positions and powers of the individuals.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[A society in which principles of justice are fair to all.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[A hypothetical society in which principles of justice are not based on the existing positions and powers of the individuals.]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section II - Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[Directions for Questions 41 to 45: <br/><br/>The passage given below is followed by a set of five questions.

Choose the most appropriate answer to each question.<br/><br/>Our propensity to look out for regularities, and to impose laws upon nature, leads to the psychological phenomenon of dogmatic thinking or, more generally, dogmatic behaviour: we expect regularities everywhere and attempt to find them even where there are none; events which do not yield to these attempts we are inclined to treat as a kind of ''background noise''; and we stick to our expectations even when they are inadequate and we ought to accept defeat. This dogmatism is to some extent necessary. It is demanded by a situation which can only be dealt with by forcing our conjectures upon the world. Moreover, this dogmatism allows us to approach a good theory in stages, by way of approximations: if we accept defeat too easily, we may prevent ourselves from finding that we were very nearly right.<br/><br/>It is clear that this dogmatic attitude, which makes us stick to our first impressions, is indicative of a strong belief; while a critical attitude, which is ready to modify its tenets, which admits doubt and demands tests, is indicative of a weaker belief Now according to Hume''s theory, and to the popular theory, the strength of a belief should be a product of repetition; thus it should always grow with experience, and always be greater in less primitive persons. But dogmatic thinking, an uncontrolled wish to impose regularities, a manifest pleasure in rites and in repetition as such, is characteristic of primitives and children; and increasing experience and maturity sometimes create an attitude of caution and criticism rather than of dogmatism.<br/><br/>My logical criticism of Hume''s psychological theory, and the considerations connected with it, may seem a Utile removed from tUe field of tUe pUilosopUy of science. But tUe distinction between dogmatic and critical thinking, or the dogmatic and the critical attitude, brings us right back to our central problem. For the dogmatic attitude is clearly related to the tendency to verify our laws and schemata by seeking to apply them and to confirm them, even to the point of neglecting refutations, whereas the critical attitude is one of readiness to change them - to test them; to refute them; to falsify them, if possible. This suggests that we may identify the critical attitude with the scientific attitude, and the dogmatic attitude with the one which we have described as pseudo-scientific. It further suggests that genetically speaking the pseudo-scientific attitude is more primitive than, and prior to, the scientific attitude: that it is a pre-scientific attitude. And this pnmitivity or priority also has its logical aspect. For the critical attitude is not so much opposed to the dogmatic attitude as super-imposed upon it: criticism must be directed against existing and influential beliefs in need of critical revision - in other words, dogmatic beliefs. A critical attitude needs for its raw material, as it were, theories or beliefs which are held more or less dogmatically.<br/><br/>Thus, science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths; neither with the collection of observations, nor with the invention of experiments, but with the critical discussion of myths, and of magical techniques and practices. The scientific tradition is distinguished from the pre-scientific tradition in having two layers. Like the latter, it passes on its theories; but it also passes on a critical attitude towards them. The theories are passed on, not as dogmas, but rather with the challenge to discuss them and improve upon them.<br/><br/>The critical attitude, the tradition of free discussion of theories with the aim of discovering their weak spots so that they may be improved upon, is the attitude of reasonableness, of rationality. From the point of view here developed, all laws, all theories, remain essentially tentative, or conjectural, or hypothetical, even when we feel unable to doubt them any longer. Before a theory has been refuted we can never know in what way it may have to be modified.<br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[2]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[According to the passage, the role of a dogmatic attitude or dogmatic behaviour in the development of science is]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[critical and important, as, without it, initial hypotheses or conjectures can never be made.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[positive, as conjectures arising out of our dogmatic attitude become science.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[negative, as it leads to pseudo-science.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[neutral, as the development of science is essentially because of our critical attitude.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[inferior to critical attitude, as a critical attitude leads to the attitude of reasonableness and rationality.]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section II - Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[Directions for Questions 46 to 50: <br/><br/>The passage given below is followed by a set of five questions.

This suggests that we may identify the critical attitude with the scientific attitude, and the dogmatic attitude with the one which we have described as pseudo-scientific. It further suggests that genetically speaking the pseudo-scientific attitude is more primitive than, and prior to, the scientific attitude: that it is a pre-scientific attitude. And this pnmitivity or priority also has its logical aspect. For the critical attitude is not so much opposed to the dogmatic attitude as super-imposed upon it: criticism must be directed against existing and influential beliefs in need of critical revision - in other words, dogmatic beliefs. A critical attitude needs for its raw material, as it were, theories or beliefs which are held more or less dogmatically.<br/><br/>Thus, science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths; neither with the collection of observations, nor with the invention of experiments, but with the critical discussion of myths, and of magical techniques and practices. The scientific tradition is distinguished from the pre-scientific tradition in having two layers. Like the latter, it passes on its theories; but it also passes on a critical attitude towards them. The theories are passed on, not as dogmas, but rather with the challenge to discuss them and improve upon them.<br/><br/>The critical attitude, the tradition of free discussion of theories with the aim of discovering their weak spots so that they may be improved upon, is the attitude of reasonableness, of rationality. From the point of view here developed, all laws, all theories, remain essentially tentative, or conjectural, or hypothetical, even when we feel unable to doubt them any longer. Before a theory has been refuted we can never know in what way it may have to be modified.<br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[1]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[Dogmatic behaviour, in this passage, has been associated with primitives and children.

Many people, especially those who are comfortably off, think that this is what happens at present: that the industrious and sober and thrifty are never in want, and that poverty is due to idleness, improvidence, drink, betting, dishonesty, and bad character generally. They can point to the fact that a labourer whose character is bad finds it more difficult to get employment than one whose character is good; that a farmer or country gentlemen who gambles and bets heavily, and mortgages his land to live wastefully and extravagantly; is soon reduced to poverty; and that a man of business who is lazy and does not attend to it becomes bankrupt. But this proves nothing that you cannot eat your cake and have it too: it does not prove that your share of the cake was a fair one. It shows that certain vices and weaknesses make us poor; but it forgets that certain other vices make us rich. People who are hard, grasping, selfish, cruel, and always ready to take advantage of their neighbours, become very rich if they are clever enough not to overreach themselves. On the other hand, people who are generous, public-spirited, friendly, and not always thinking of the main chance, stay poor when they are born poor unless they have extraordinary talents. Also as things are today, some are born poor and others are born with silver spoons in their mouths: that is to say, they are divided into rich and poor before they are old enough to have any character at all. The notion that our present system distributes wealth according to merit, even roughly, may be dismissed at once as ridiculous. Everyone can see that it generally has the contrary effect; it makes a few idle people very rich, and a great many hardworking people very poor.<br/><br/>On this, Intelligent Lady, your first thought may be that if wealth is not distributed according to merit, it ought to be; and that we should at once set to work to alter our laws so that in future the good people shall be rich in proportion to their goodness and the bad people poor in proportion to their badness. There are several objections to this; but the very first one settles the question for good. It is, that the proposal is impossible. How are you going to measure anyone''s merit in money? Choose any pair of human beings you like, male or female, and see whether you can decide how much each of them should have on her or his merits. If you live in the country, take the village blacksmith and the village clergyman, or the village washerwoman and the village schoolmistress, to begin with. At present the clergyman often gets less pay than the blacksmith: it is only in some villages that he gets more. But never mind what they get at present: you are trying whether you can set up a new order of things in which each will get what he deserves. You need not fix a sum of money for them: all you have to do is to settle the proportion between them. Is the blacksmith to have as much as the clergyman? Or twice as much as the clergyman? Or half as much as the clergyman? Or how much more or less? It is no use saying that one ought to have more the other less: you must be prepared to say exactly how much more or less in calculable proportion.<br/><br/>Well, think it out. The clergyman has had a college education; but that is not any merit on his part: he owns it to his father; so you cannot allow him anything for that. But through it he is able to read the New Testament in Greek; so that he can do something the blacksmith cannot do. On the other hand, the blacksmith can make a horse-shoe, which the parson cannot. How many verses of the Greek Testament are worth one horseshoe? You have only to ask the silly question to see that nobody can answer it.<br/><br/>Since measuring their merits is no use, why not try to measure their faults? Suppose the blacksmith swears a good deal, and gets drunk occasionally! Everybody in the village knows this; but the parson has to keep his faults to himself. His wife knows them; but she will not tell you what they are if she knows that you intend to cut off some of his pay for them. You know that as he is only a mortal human being he must have some faults; but you cannot find them out. However, suppose he has some faults that you can find out! Suppose he has what you call an unfortunate manner; that he is a hypocrite; that he is a snob; that he cares more for sport and fashionable society than for religion! Does that make him as bad as the blacksmith, or twice as bad, or twice and a quarter as bad, or only half as bad? In other words, if the blacksmith is to have a shilling, is the parson to have sixpence, or five pence and one-third, or two shillings? Clearly these are fools'' questions: the moment they bring us down from moral generalities to business particulars it becomes plain to every sensible person that no relation can be established between human qualities, good or bad, and sums of money, large or small. It may seem scandalous that a prize -fighter so hard at Wembley that he fell down and could not rise within ten seconds, received the same sum that was paid to the Archbishop of Canterbury for acting as Primate of the Church of England for nine months; but none of these who cry out against the scandal can express any better in money the difference between the two.

Many people, especially those who are comfortably off, think that this is what happens at present: that the industrious and sober and thrifty are never in want, and that poverty is due to idleness, improvidence, drink, betting, dishonesty, and bad character generally. They can point to the fact that a labourer whose character is bad finds it more difficult to get employment than one whose character is good; that a farmer or country gentlemen who gambles and bets heavily, and mortgages his land to live wastefully and extravagantly; is soon reduced to poverty; and that a man of business who is lazy and does not attend to it becomes bankrupt. But this proves nothing that you cannot eat your cake and have it too: it does not prove that your share of the cake was a fair one. It shows that certain vices and weaknesses make us poor; but it forgets that certain other vices make us rich. People who are hard, grasping, selfish, cruel, and always ready to take advantage of their neighbours, become very rich if they are clever enough not to overreach themselves. On the other hand, people who are generous, public-spirited, friendly, and not always thinking of the main chance, stay poor when they are born poor unless they have extraordinary talents. Also as things are today, some are born poor and others are born with silver spoons in their mouths: that is to say, they are divided into rich and poor before they are old enough to have any character at all. The notion that our present system distributes wealth according to merit, even roughly, may be dismissed at once as ridiculous. Everyone can see that it generally has the contrary effect; it makes a few idle people very rich, and a great many hardworking people very poor.<br/><br/>On this, Intelligent Lady, your first thought may be that if wealth is not distributed according to merit, it ought to be; and that we should at once set to work to alter our laws so that in future the good people shall be rich in proportion to their goodness and the bad people poor in proportion to their badness. There are several objections to this; but the very first one settles the question for good. It is, that the proposal is impossible. How are you going to measure anyone''s merit in money? Choose any pair of human beings you like, male or female, and see whether you can decide how much each of them should have on her or his merits. If you live in the country, take the village blacksmith and the village clergyman, or the village washerwoman and the village schoolmistress, to begin with. At present the clergyman often gets less pay than the blacksmith: it is only in some villages that he gets more. But never mind what they get at present: you are trying whether you can set up a new order of things in which each will get what he deserves. You need not fix a sum of money for them: all you have to do is to settle the proportion between them. Is the blacksmith to have as much as the clergyman? Or twice as much as the clergyman? Or half as much as the clergyman? Or how much more or less? It is no use saying that one ought to have more the other less: you must be prepared to say exactly how much more or less in calculable proportion.<br/><br/>Well, think it out. The clergyman has had a college education; but that is not any merit on his part: he owns it to his father; so you cannot allow him anything for that. But through it he is able to read the New Testament in Greek; so that he can do something the blacksmith cannot do. On the other hand, the blacksmith can make a horse-shoe, which the parson cannot. How many verses of the Greek Testament are worth one horseshoe? You have only to ask the silly question to see that nobody can answer it.<br/><br/>Since measuring their merits is no use, why not try to measure their faults? Suppose the blacksmith swears a good deal, and gets drunk occasionally! Everybody in the village knows this; but the parson has to keep his faults to himself. His wife knows them; but she will not tell you what they are if she knows that you intend to cut off some of his pay for them. You know that as he is only a mortal human being he must have some faults; but you cannot find them out. However, suppose he has some faults that you can find out! Suppose he has what you call an unfortunate manner; that he is a hypocrite; that he is a snob; that he cares more for sport and fashionable society than for religion! Does that make him as bad as the blacksmith, or twice as bad, or twice and a quarter as bad, or only half as bad? In other words, if the blacksmith is to have a shilling, is the parson to have sixpence, or five pence and one-third, or two shillings? Clearly these are fools'' questions: the moment they bring us down from moral generalities to business particulars it becomes plain to every sensible person that no relation can be established between human qualities, good or bad, and sums of money, large or small. It may seem scandalous that a prize -fighter so hard at Wembley that he fell down and could not rise within ten seconds, received the same sum that was paid to the Archbishop of Canterbury for acting as Primate of the Church of England for nine months; but none of these who cry out against the scandal can express any better in money the difference between the two.

But through it he is able to read the New Testament in Greek; so that he can do something the blacksmith cannot do. On the other hand, the blacksmith can make a horse-shoe, which the parson cannot. How many verses of the Greek Testament are worth one horseshoe? You have only to ask the silly question to see that nobody can answer it.<br/><br/>Since measuring their merits is no use, why not try to measure their faults? Suppose the blacksmith swears a good deal, and gets drunk occasionally! Everybody in the village knows this; but the parson has to keep his faults to himself. His wife knows them; but she will not tell you what they are if she knows that you intend to cut off some of his pay for them. You know that as he is only a mortal human being he must have some faults; but you cannot find them out. However, suppose he has some faults that you can find out! Suppose he has what you call an unfortunate manner; that he is a hypocrite; that he is a snob; that he cares more for sport and fashionable society than for religion! Does that make him as bad as the blacksmith, or twice as bad, or twice and a quarter as bad, or only half as bad? In other words, if the blacksmith is to have a shilling, is the parson to have sixpence, or five pence and one-third, or two shillings? Clearly these are fools'' questions: the moment they bring us down from moral generalities to business particulars it becomes plain to every sensible person that no relation can be established between human qualities, good or bad, and sums of money, large or small. It may seem scandalous that a prize -fighter so hard at Wembley that he fell down and could not rise within ten seconds, received the same sum that was paid to the Archbishop of Canterbury for acting as Primate of the Church of England for nine months; but none of these who cry out against the scandal can express any better in money the difference between the two. Not one of the persons who think that the prize -fighter should get less than the archbishop can say how much less. What the prize-fighter got for his six or seven minutes'' boxing would pay a judge''s salary for two years; and we are all agreed that nothing could be more ridiculous, and that any system of distributing wealth which leads to such absurdities must be wrong. But to suppose that it could be changed by any possible calculation that an ounce of archbishop or three ounces of judge is worth a pound of prize-fighter would be sillier still. You can find out how many candles are worth a pound of butter in the market on any particular day; but when you try to estimate the worth of human souls, the utmost you can say is that they are all of equal value before the throne of God. And that will not help you in the least to settle how much money they should have. You must simply give it up, and admit that distributing money according to merit is beyond mortal measurement and judgement.<br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[3]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[The author gives the example of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the prize-fighter to:]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[prove that there cannot be any division of wealth based on moral standards.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[prove that in this day and age, might always scores over religion and love.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[prove the existence of a non-discriminating god.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[prove that a pound of butter in worth more than any amount of candles any day.]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section III - Reading Comprehension & Verbal Ability]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[DIRECTIONS for Questions 41 to 54: Read the passages and answer the questions based on them.<br/><br/>PASSAGE - I<br/><br/>The second plan to have to examine is that of giving to each person what she deserves. Many people, especially those who are comfortably off, think that this is what happens at present: that the industrious and sober and thrifty are never in want, and that poverty is due to idleness, improvidence, drink, betting, dishonesty, and bad character generally. They can point to the fact that a labourer whose character is bad finds it more difficult to get employment than one whose character is good; that a farmer or country gentlemen who gambles and bets heavily, and mortgages his land to live wastefully and extravagantly; is soon reduced to poverty; and that a man of business who is lazy and does not attend to it becomes bankrupt. But this proves nothing that you cannot eat your cake and have it too: it does not prove that your share of the cake was a fair one. It shows that certain vices and weaknesses make us poor; but it forgets that certain other vices make us rich. People who are hard, grasping, selfish, cruel, and always ready to take advantage of their neighbours, become very rich if they are clever enough not to overreach themselves. On the other hand, people who are generous, public-spirited, friendly, and not always thinking of the main chance, stay poor when they are born poor unless they have extraordinary talents. Also as things are today, some are born poor and others are born with silver spoons in their mouths: that is to say, they are divided into rich and poor before they are old enough to have any character at all. The notion that our present system distributes wealth according to merit, even roughly, may be dismissed at once as ridiculous. Everyone can see that it generally has the contrary effect; it makes a few idle people very rich, and a great many hardworking people very poor.<br/><br/>On this, Intelligent Lady, your first thought may be that if wealth is not distributed according to merit, it ought to be; and that we should at once set to work to alter our laws so that in future the good people shall be rich in proportion to their goodness and the bad people poor in proportion to their badness. There are several objections to this; but the very first one settles the question for good. It is, that the proposal is impossible. How are you going to measure anyone''s merit in money? Choose any pair of human beings you like, male or female, and see whether you can decide how much each of them should have on her or his merits. If you live in the country, take the village blacksmith and the village clergyman, or the village washerwoman and the village schoolmistress, to begin with. At present the clergyman often gets less pay than the blacksmith: it is only in some villages that he gets more. But never mind what they get at present: you are trying whether you can set up a new order of things in which each will get what he deserves. You need not fix a sum of money for them: all you have to do is to settle the proportion between them. Is the blacksmith to have as much as the clergyman? Or twice as much as the clergyman? Or half as much as the clergyman? Or how much more or less?

And the astonishing thing is that no party has sought to ride this particular wave; instead, all are on the defensive, desperately evading the real issues.

There is no central personality of whom voters have to express approval or dislike; no central matter of concern that makes this a one-issue referendum like so many elections in the past; no central party around which everything else revolves -- the Congress has been displaced from its customary pole position, and no one else has been able to take its place. Indeed, given that all-seeing video cameras of the Election Commission, and the detailed pictures they are putting together on campaign expenditure, there isn''t even much electioneering: no slogans on the walls, no loudspeakers blaring forth at all hours of the day and night, no cavalcades of cars heralding the arrival of a candidate at the local bazaar.

But even the general election, involving nearly 600 million voters, has been reduced to a boring non event. After all, the Nehru-Gandhi clan has disappeared from the political map, and the majority of voters will not even be able to name PV Narasimha Rao as India''s Prime Minister. There could be as many as a dozen prime ministerial candidates ranging from Jyoti Basu to Ramakrishna Hegde, and from Chandra Shekar to (believe it or not) KR Narayanan.

Economic reform is a non-issue for most people and with inflation down to barely 4%, prices are not top of the mind either. In a strange twist, after the hawala scandal, corruption has been pushed off the map too. <br/><br/>But ponder for a moment. Isn''t this state of affairs astonishing given the context? Consider that so many ministers have had to resign over the hawala issue; that a governor who was a cabinet minister has also had to quit in the wake of judicial displeasure; that the prime minister himself is under investigation for his involvement in not one scandal but two; that the main prime ministerial candidate from the opposition has had to how out because he too has been charged in the hawala case; and that the head of the "third force" has his own little (or not so little) fodder scandal to face. Why then is corruption not an issue -- not as a matter of competitive politics, but as an issue on which the contenders for power feel they have to offer the prospect of genuine change? If all this does not make the parties (almost all of whom have broken the law in not submitting their audited accounts every year to the income tax authorities) realise that the country both needs -- and is ready for -- change in fundamental ways, what will? Think also, for a moment, of the change in the functioning and attitude of the Supreme Court; the assertiveness of the Election Commission, giving new life to a model code of conduct that has been ignored for a quarter century; the independence that has been thrust upon the Central Bureau of Investigation; and the fresh zeal on the part of tax collectors out to nab corporate no -gooders. Think also that at no other point since the Emergency of 1975-77 have so many people in power been hounded by the system for their misdeeds.<br/><br/>In this just a case of a few individuals outside the political system doing their job, or is the country heading for a few era?

Thus, while buying 100 cm of cloth, he pays just (100/120), i.e. (5/6) times the actual worth of the goods. If he has 100 cm of material, then while selling, he charges the customer for (100/80), i.e. (5/4) times the actual worth of goods sold. On this SP, he gives a discount of 20%, thus making the actuarial SP as (0.8)(5/4) = 1. Thus for 100 cm of cloth, his CP is (5/6) while the SP is 1.

The subsidy culture has gone to extremes: cooking gas (used mostly by the top 10% of income-earners) has been sold at barely half its cost. The wealthiest people in the country have had access for years to subsidised sugar. The richest farmers in the country get subsidised fertiliser. University education, typically accessed by the wealthier sections, is charged at a fraction of cost. Postal services are subsidised, and so are railway passengers. Bus fares cannot be raised to economical levels because there will be violent protests, so bus travel is subsidised too. In the past, price control on a variety of items, from steel to cement, meant that industrial consumers of these items got them at less than cost while the losses of the public sector companies that produced them were borne by the taxpayer! One study, done a few years ago, came to the conclusion that subsidies in the Indian economy total as much as 14.5% of gross domestic product. At today''s level, that would work out to about Rs. 150,000 crore.<br/><br/>And who pays the bill? The theory -- and the political fiction on the basis of which it is sold to unsuspecting voters -- is that subsidies go to the poor, and are paid for by the rich. The fact is that most subsidies go to the "rich" (defined in the Indian context as those who are above the poverty line), and much of the tab goes indirectly to the poor. Because the hefty subsidy bill results in fiscal deficits, which in turn push up rates of inflation -- which, as everyone knows, hits the poor the hardest of all.

That people cannot afford to pay for a variety of goods and services, and therefore the government must step in. This thesis has been applied not just in the poor countries but in the rich ones as well; hence the birth of the welfare state in the West, and an almost Utopian social security system: free medical care, food aid, old age security, et al. But with the passage of time, most of the wealthy nations have discovered that their economies cannot sustain this social safety net, that it in fact reduces the desire among people to pay their own way, and takes away some of the incentive to work. In short, the bill was unaffordable, and their societies were simply not willing to pay. To the regret of many, but because the laws of economics are harsh, most Western societies have been busy pruning the welfare bill.<br/> In India, the lessons of this experience -- over several decades, and in many countries -- do not seem to have been learnt. Or, they are simply ignored in the pursuit of immediate votes. People who are promised cheap food or clothing do not in most cases look beyond the gift horses -- to the question of who picks up the tab. The uproar over higher petrol, diesel and cooking gas prices ignored this basic question: if the user of cooking gas does not want to pay for its cost, who should pay? Diesel in the country is subsidised, and if the trucker or owner of a diesel generator does not want to pay for its full cost, who does he or she think should pay the balance of the cost? It is a simple question, nevertheless it remains unasked.<br/><br/>The government has shown some courage in biting the bullet when it comes to the price of petroleum products.

And, of course, who will pick up the tab? The Andhra Pradesh government has been bankrupted by selling rice at Rs 2 per kg. Should the central government be bankrupted too before facing up to the question of what is affordable and what is not? Already, India is perennially short of power because the subsidy on electricity has bankrupted most electricity boards, and made private investment wary unless it gets all manner of state guarantees. Delhi''s subsidised bus fares have bankrupted the Delhi Transport Corp, whose buses have slowly disappeared from the capital''s streets.

Schleiden and Schwann, when setting forth the cell doctrine in the 1830''s, considered that it had a central role in growth and development. Their belief has been fully supported even though they had only vague notions as to what that role might be, and how the role was to be expressed in some cellular action. The membraneless nuclear area of the prokaryotic cell, with its tangle of fine threads, is now known to play a similar role.<br/><br/>Some cells, like the sieve tubes of vascular plants and the red blood cells of mammals, do not possess nuclei during the greater part of their existence, although they had nuclei when in a less differentiated state. Such cells can no longer divide and their life span is limited. Other cells are regularly multinucleate. Some, like the cells of striated muscles or the latex vessels of higher plants, become so through cell fusion. Some, like the unicellular protozoan Paramecium, are normally binucleate, one of the nuclei serving as a source of hereditary information for the next generation, the other governing the day-to-day metabolic activities of the cell. Still other organisms, such as some fungi, are multinucleate because cross walls, dividing the mycelium into specific cells, are absent or irregularly present. The uninucleate situation, however, is typical for the vast majority of cells, and it would appear that this is the most efficient and most economical manner of partitioning living substance into manageable units. This point of view is given credence not only by the prevalence of uninucleate cells, but because for each kind of cell there is a ratio maintained between the volume of the nucleus and that of the cytoplasm. If we think of the nucleus as the control centre of the cell, this would suggest that for a given kind of cell performing a given kind of work, one nucleus can "take care of" a specific volume of cytoplasm and keep it in functioning order. In terms of materials and energy, this must mean providing the kind of information needed to keep flow of materials and energy moving at the correct rate and in the proper channels. With the multitude of enzymes in the cell, materials and energy can of course be channelled in a multitude of ways; it is the function of some informational molecules to make channels of use more preferred than others at any given time. How this regulatory control is exercised is not entirely clear.<br/><br/> The nucleus is generally a rounded body. In plant cells, however, where the centre of the cell is often occupied by a large vacuole, the nucleus may be pushed against the cell wall, causing it to assume a lens shape. In some white blood cells, such as polymorphonucleated leukocytes, and in cells of the spinning gland of some insects and spiders, the nucleus is very much lobed. The reason for this is not clear, but it may relate to the fact that for a given volume of nucleus, a lobate form provides a much greater surface area nuclear-cytoplasmic exchanges, possibly affecting both the rate and the amount of metabolic reactions. The nucleus, whatever its shape, is segregated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane, the nuclear envelope, with the two membranes separated from each other by a perinuclear space of varying width. The envelope is absent only during the time of cell division, and then just for a brief period. The outer membrane is often continuous with the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, a possible retention of an earlier relationship, since the envelope, at least in part, is formed at the end of cell division by coalescing fragments of the endoplasmic reticulum. The cytoplasm side of the nucleus is frequently coated with ribosomes, another fact that stresses the similarity and relation of the nuclear envelope to the endoplasmic reticulum. The inner membrane seems to possess a crystalline layer where it abuts the nucleoplasm, but its function remains to be determined.<br/><br/>Everything that passes between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in the eukaryotic cell must transverse the nuclear envelope. This includes some fairly large molecules as well as bodies such as ribosomes, which measure about 25 mm in diameter.

Their belief has been fully supported even though they had only vague notions as to what that role might be, and how the role was to be expressed in some cellular action. The membraneless nuclear area of the prokaryotic cell, with its tangle of fine threads, is now known to play a similar role.<br/><br/>Some cells, like the sieve tubes of vascular plants and the red blood cells of mammals, do not possess nuclei during the greater part of their existence, although they had nuclei when in a less differentiated state. Such cells can no longer divide and their life span is limited. Other cells are regularly multinucleate. Some, like the cells of striated muscles or the latex vessels of higher plants, become so through cell fusion. Some, like the unicellular protozoan Paramecium, are normally binucleate, one of the nuclei serving as a source of hereditary information for the next generation, the other governing the day-to-day metabolic activities of the cell. Still other organisms, such as some fungi, are multinucleate because cross walls, dividing the mycelium into specific cells, are absent or irregularly present. The uninucleate situation, however, is typical for the vast majority of cells, and it would appear that this is the most efficient and most economical manner of partitioning living substance into manageable units. This point of view is given credence not only by the prevalence of uninucleate cells, but because for each kind of cell there is a ratio maintained between the volume of the nucleus and that of the cytoplasm. If we think of the nucleus as the control centre of the cell, this would suggest that for a given kind of cell performing a given kind of work, one nucleus can "take care of" a specific volume of cytoplasm and keep it in functioning order. In terms of materials and energy, this must mean providing the kind of information needed to keep flow of materials and energy moving at the correct rate and in the proper channels.

How this regulatory control is exercised is not entirely clear.<br/><br/> The nucleus is generally a rounded body. In plant cells, however, where the centre of the cell is often occupied by a large vacuole, the nucleus may be pushed against the cell wall, causing it to assume a lens shape. In some white blood cells, such as polymorphonucleated leukocytes, and in cells of the spinning gland of some insects and spiders, the nucleus is very much lobed. The reason for this is not clear, but it may relate to the fact that for a given volume of nucleus, a lobate form provides a much greater surface area nuclear-cytoplasmic exchanges, possibly affecting both the rate and the amount of metabolic reactions. The nucleus, whatever its shape, is segregated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane, the nuclear envelope, with the two membranes separated from each other by a perinuclear space of varying width. The envelope is absent only during the time of cell division, and then just for a brief period. The outer membrane is often continuous with the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, a possible retention of an earlier relationship, since the envelope, at least in part, is formed at the end of cell division by coalescing fragments of the endoplasmic reticulum. The cytoplasm side of the nucleus is frequently coated with ribosomes, another fact that stresses the similarity and relation of the nuclear envelope to the endoplasmic reticulum. The inner membrane seems to possess a crystalline layer where it abuts the nucleoplasm, but its function remains to be determined.<br/><br/>Everything that passes between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in the eukaryotic cell must transverse the nuclear envelope.

If there is pay discrimination against some group of players -- fewer teams bidding for black players thus lowering the salaries for blacks with the same ability as whites -- that neat relation may no longer hold.

To feel less than someone or something - the definition of inferiority - is natural in childhood when we are surrounded by the incomprehensible and things that other, ''bigger'' people seem to take in their stride.<br/>A.   But if a child is made to feel inadequate in some way, this natural feeling can crystalise into a sense of not being good enough, clever enough, or able enough and years later surface as a sense of inferiority.<br/>B.   A wise parent will reassure the child through explanation and ensure that he grows through each new experience.<br/>C.   If, with practice, that expectation and attitude can be changed, the whole family can benefit.<br/> D.   Often such a feeling can be handed down subliminally from parent to child, through many generations, without anyone realizing that this is happening.<br/>E.

(a) Both E and F score 14 points in which case the answer would be 3 possible winners, or (b) atleast one of E or F score 14 points, making two possible winners, or (d) both E and F scoring an equal number of points but higher than A making again 2 possible winners,<br/><br/>For (a) to happen, E and F would have (2 wins, 2 draws and 1 loss). This is not possible as overall number of wins must be equal to overall number of draws. However only (b) can happen. For (b), E or F =  (2,2,1) and F or E respectively = (1,2,2).

The law has  had  many  statements  and  many  names  and  has  become  best  known  as  The  Principle  of Competitive  Exclusion,  or  Gause''s  Hypothesis,  after  the  Soviet  biologist  G.F.  Gause,  whose experimental studies in the area appeared in a 1934 monograph, The Struggle for Existence (Williams & Wilkins Company, Baltimore, Md.). The principle as set forth in the Encyclopedia Britannica, 15th edition, states "Populations of two species cannot persist together for a very long time in the same community when both compete for and are limited by a common resource". The social problem to which  this  principles  relates  is  that  of  two  culturally  isolated,  non-interbreeding  populations  that occupy the same country.<br/><br/>Before we can focus on the social problem we must go back a bit into evolutionary and population biology to understand the implications of the Gause Hypothesis. Biologists usually define a species in terms of an interbreeding population. If such a population is isolated into two subgroups that do not interbreed  because  of  geographical  barriers,  then  each  group  experiences  different  environmental pressures  and  different  genetic  drifts.  Eventually  the  descendants  of  the  two  original  populations, many,  many  generation  later,  will  be  sufficiently  speciated  so  that  they  will  not  interbreed.  Two species will have arisen from a single initial species. Between the original species and the final two species  there  will  be  an  intermediate  stage  at  which  the  two  groups  will  show  morphological differences but will still interbreed. At this stage the two groups are subspecies or races. The same factors operate in human populations and it must be argued that if any human subgroup were kept in complete reproductive isolation from the rest of mankind it would eventually become a new species. Because human sexuality is periodically stronger than cultural barriers, this type of speciation seems most unlikely for Homo sapiens.<br/><br/>The  consequence  of  the  principle  we  have  been  discussing  is  that  when  two  similar  species  find themselves in direct competition one of two things happens: 1) one species is eliminated by death or displacement;  2)  one  species  modifies  its  behavior  either  adaptively  or  genetically  so  there  is  no longer competition for a common resource. The two species can then coexist.<br/><br/>Two  non-interbreeding  human  populations  in  the  same community present a  close  analogue  to  the Gause Hypothesis. While in nature we have only genetic speciation, in human interactions we have cultural speciation, where members of two groups in a community do not interbreed for cultural rather than for biological reasons. If the two groups are in competition for a limited resource such as land, food, jobs, or housing, we must assume that the principle of competitive exclusion will operate and we will observe a period of unpleasantness and strife that will result in one of the sequels listed above. In human populations there is a third possibility: the cultural barriers are lowered and the groups merge to  a  single  unit  where  intragroup  competition  rather  than  intergroup  competition  governs  the subsequent behavior.<br/><br/>The question we must raise asks about the possibility of a solution that does not consider the principle of competitive exclusion.

The law has  had  many  statements  and  many  names  and  has  become  best  known  as  The  Principle  of Competitive  Exclusion,  or  Gause''s  Hypothesis,  after  the  Soviet  biologist  G.F.  Gause,  whose experimental studies in the area appeared in a 1934 monograph, The Struggle for Existence (Williams & Wilkins Company, Baltimore, Md.). The principle as set forth in the Encyclopedia Britannica, 15th edition, states "Populations of two species cannot persist together for a very long time in the same community when both compete for and are limited by a common resource". The social problem to which  this  principles  relates  is  that  of  two  culturally  isolated,  non-interbreeding  populations  that occupy the same country.<br/><br/>Before we can focus on the social problem we must go back a bit into evolutionary and population biology to understand the implications of the Gause Hypothesis. Biologists usually define a species in terms of an interbreeding population. If such a population is isolated into two subgroups that do not interbreed  because  of  geographical  barriers,  then  each  group  experiences  different  environmental pressures  and  different  genetic  drifts.  Eventually  the  descendants  of  the  two  original  populations, many,  many  generation  later,  will  be  sufficiently  speciated  so  that  they  will  not  interbreed.  Two species will have arisen from a single initial species. Between the original species and the final two species  there  will  be  an  intermediate  stage  at  which  the  two  groups  will  show  morphological differences but will still interbreed. At this stage the two groups are subspecies or races. The same factors operate in human populations and it must be argued that if any human subgroup were kept in complete reproductive isolation from the rest of mankind it would eventually become a new species. Because human sexuality is periodically stronger than cultural barriers, this type of speciation seems most unlikely for Homo sapiens.<br/><br/>The  consequence  of  the  principle  we  have  been  discussing  is  that  when  two  similar  species  find themselves in direct competition one of two things happens: 1) one species is eliminated by death or displacement;  2)  one  species  modifies  its  behavior  either  adaptively  or  genetically  so  there  is  no longer competition for a common resource. The two species can then coexist.<br/><br/>Two  non-interbreeding  human  populations  in  the  same community present a  close  analogue  to  the Gause Hypothesis. While in nature we have only genetic speciation, in human interactions we have cultural speciation, where members of two groups in a community do not interbreed for cultural rather than for biological reasons. If the two groups are in competition for a limited resource such as land, food, jobs, or housing, we must assume that the principle of competitive exclusion will operate and we will observe a period of unpleasantness and strife that will result in one of the sequels listed above. In human populations there is a third possibility: the cultural barriers are lowered and the groups merge to  a  single  unit  where  intragroup  competition  rather  than  intergroup  competition  governs  the subsequent behavior.<br/><br/>The question we must raise asks about the possibility of a solution that does not consider the principle of competitive exclusion.

The first is the atom, with its negatively charged electrons orbiting a positive nucleus. The other is the pattern of  radiation  emitted  by heated  objects.  According to  classical physics, atoms should not exist. The moving  electron  should  radiate  away  its  energy;  slow  down  and  so  spiral  inwards  and  collapse. Classical  physics  also  embarrassingly  predicts  that  hot  objects  should  radiate  infinite  amounts  of energy in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. They do not.<br/><br/>In the early years of this century, quantum mechanics managed to explain the awkward existence of atoms  and  the  recalcitrant  facts  of  radiation,  thanks  to  a  simple  device.  It  assumed  -  with  little justification  at  the  time,  except  that  the  idea  seemed  to  work  -  that  physical  quantities  are  not infinitely divisible but come in chunks, called quanta.

Though the idea had  been foreshadowed  by Freud  and stressed   by   Wilhelm   Reich,   there   had   never   been   anything   particularly   ecstatic   about psychoanalysts,  or  their  patients. They  seemed,  on  the  whole,  emotionally  catharticized  and drearily  mature.   Ecstasy,  in  the  form  of  mystical  experience,  had  also  been  the  objective  of  a growing minority that, since the beginning of the century, had been fascinated with yoga, Tibetan Buddhism,  Zen, Vedanta, and other forms of Oriental meditation; and these people were always rather serious and demure.<br/><br/> But in the sixties, everything blew up.  Something almost like a mutation broke out among people from fifteen to twenty-five, to the utter consternation of the adult world.   From San Francisco to Katmandu,  there  suddenly  appeared  multitudes  of  hippies  with  hair,  beards,  and  costumes  that disquietingly reminded their elders of Jesus Christ, the prophets, and the apostles - who were all at a  safe  historical  distance.  At  the  peak  of  our  technological  affluence,  these  young  people renounced  the  cherished  values  of  Western  Civilization  -  the  values  of  property  and  status. Richness  of  experience,  they  maintained,  was  far  more  important  than  things  and  money,  in pursuit of which their parents were miserably and dutifully trapped in squirrel cages.<br/><br/>Scandalously, hippies did not adopt the ascetic and celibate ways of traditional holy men.   They took  drugs,  held  sexual  orgies  and  substituted  free-loving  communities  for  the  hallowed  family circle.   Those who hoped that all this was just an adolescent quest for kicks that would soon fade away were  increasingly alarmed,  for  it  appeared  to  be in lively earnest.   The hippies moved  on from marijuana and LSD to Hindu chants and yoga, hardly aware that mysticism, in the form of realizing  that  one''s  true  self  is  the  Godhead,  is  something  Western  society  would  not  tolerate. After all look what happened to Jesus.   Mysticism, or democracy in the kingdom of God, seemed arrant  subversion  and  blasphemy  to  people  whose  official  image  of  God  had  always  been monarchical  -  the  cosmic  counterpart  of  the  Pharaohs  and  Cyruses  of  the  ancient  world. Mysticism was therefore persecuted alike by church and state, and the taboo still continued - with assistance    from   the    psychiatric    inquisition. Admittedly,    the    hippies   were   credulous, undiscriminating,  and  immoderate  in  their  spiritual  explorations. But  if  the  approach  was fumbling, the goal was clear.  I have before me a faded copy of the summer 1969 bulletin of what was  then  California''s  revolutionary  Mid  peninsula  Free  University  (now  the  world  respected Castalia University of Menlo Park), which bluntly affirms that "The natural state of man is ecstatic wonder; we should not settle for less".<br/><br/>Looking  back  from  1990,  all  this  is  very  understandable,  however  inept.   The  flower  children knew what their parents hardly dared contemplate: that they had no future.   At any moment, they might suffer  instant cremation by the H-bomb or the slower and grislier dooms of chemical and biological warfare.   The history of man''s behaviour warned them that armaments which exist are almost  invariably used  and  may even  go  off  by themselves.   By the  end  of  1970,  their  protests against the power structure of the West (which from their standpoint included Russia), combined with  the  Black-Power  movement,  had  so  infuriated  the  military  industrial  police  labor  union- Mafia complex known as the ''establishment'' that the United States was close to civil war.<br/><br/>Happily, it was just then that the leading scientists, philosophers, and responsible statesmen of the world  abruptly  called  factionists  and  politicians  to  their  senses.   They  solemnly  proclaimed  an ecological crisis and put it so bluntly that the world almost went into panic. Ideological, national, and   racial  disputes  were  children''s  tiffs  in  comparison  with  the  many  headed  menace  of overpopulation, totally inadequate food production, shortage of water, erosion of soil, pollution of air and water, deforestation, poisoned food, and utter chemicals imbalance of nature.  By 1974, no one could refuse to see that all extravagant military and space projects must forthwith be canceled and every energy diverted to feeding and cleansing the world.

Ecstasy,  in  the  form  of  mystical  experience,  had  also  been  the  objective  of  a growing minority that, since the beginning of the century, had been fascinated with yoga, Tibetan Buddhism,  Zen, Vedanta, and other forms of Oriental meditation; and these people were always rather serious and demure.<br/><br/> But in the sixties, everything blew up.  Something almost like a mutation broke out among people from fifteen to twenty-five, to the utter consternation of the adult world.   From San Francisco to Katmandu,  there  suddenly  appeared  multitudes  of  hippies  with  hair,  beards,  and  costumes  that disquietingly reminded their elders of Jesus Christ, the prophets, and the apostles - who were all at a  safe  historical  distance.  At  the  peak  of  our  technological  affluence,  these  young  people renounced  the  cherished  values  of  Western  Civilization  -  the  values  of  property  and  status. Richness  of  experience,  they  maintained,  was  far  more  important  than  things  and  money,  in pursuit of which their parents were miserably and dutifully trapped in squirrel cages.<br/><br/>Scandalously, hippies did not adopt the ascetic and celibate ways of traditional holy men.   They took  drugs,  held  sexual  orgies  and  substituted  free-loving  communities  for  the  hallowed  family circle.   Those who hoped that all this was just an adolescent quest for kicks that would soon fade away were  increasingly alarmed,  for  it  appeared  to  be in lively earnest.   The hippies moved  on from marijuana and LSD to Hindu chants and yoga, hardly aware that mysticism, in the form of realizing  that  one''s  true  self  is  the  Godhead,  is  something  Western  society  would  not  tolerate. After all look what happened to Jesus.   Mysticism, or democracy in the kingdom of God, seemed arrant  subversion  and  blasphemy  to  people  whose  official  image  of  God  had  always  been monarchical  -  the  cosmic  counterpart  of  the  Pharaohs  and  Cyruses  of  the  ancient  world. Mysticism was therefore persecuted alike by church and state, and the taboo still continued - with assistance    from   the    psychiatric    inquisition. Admittedly,    the    hippies   were   credulous, undiscriminating,  and  immoderate  in  their  spiritual  explorations. But  if  the  approach  was fumbling, the goal was clear.  I have before me a faded copy of the summer 1969 bulletin of what was  then  California''s  revolutionary  Mid  peninsula  Free  University  (now  the  world  respected Castalia University of Menlo Park), which bluntly affirms that "The natural state of man is ecstatic wonder; we should not settle for less".<br/><br/>Looking  back  from  1990,  all  this  is  very  understandable,  however  inept.   The  flower  children knew what their parents hardly dared contemplate: that they had no future.   At any moment, they might suffer  instant cremation by the H-bomb or the slower and grislier dooms of chemical and biological warfare.   The history of man''s behaviour warned them that armaments which exist are almost  invariably used  and  may even  go  off  by themselves.   By the  end  of  1970,  their  protests against the power structure of the West (which from their standpoint included Russia), combined with  the  Black-Power  movement,  had  so  infuriated  the  military  industrial  police  labor  union- Mafia complex known as the ''establishment'' that the United States was close to civil war.<br/><br/>Happily, it was just then that the leading scientists, philosophers, and responsible statesmen of the world  abruptly  called  factionists  and  politicians  to  their  senses.   They  solemnly  proclaimed  an ecological crisis and put it so bluntly that the world almost went into panic. Ideological, national, and   racial  disputes  were  children''s  tiffs  in  comparison  with  the  many  headed  menace  of overpopulation, totally inadequate food production, shortage of water, erosion of soil, pollution of air and water, deforestation, poisoned food, and utter chemicals imbalance of nature.  By 1974, no one could refuse to see that all extravagant military and space projects must forthwith be canceled and every energy diverted to feeding and cleansing the world.  Had this not happened, I could not be writing to you.  Civilization would not have endured beyond 1980 and certainly would not have taken its present direction.   For we have gone a long way in persuading people that "the natural state of man is ecstatic wonder."<br/><br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[3]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[According to Jung,]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[homo-sapiens learns words because it is in their genes to do so, and that cannot be taken away.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[while the mind is ready to learn things in a particular way it requires to be triggered to actually learn.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[People of different cultures not only speak different languages, but also inherit different sensory worlds.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[the mind of a new-born child is like an empty vessel, waiting to be filled,]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section 3 - Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[<b>Section 3</b><br/><br/>Passage 2<br/><br/> A  social  world  view,  one  shared  with  other  people,  is  structured  from  our  infant  minds  by  the impingements  on  us  from,  and  the  verifying  responses  to  us  by,  other  people.

Their world view is either scanty or different for they are always feeble minded at best. In 1951 a child was found in an Irish chicken house, having somehow survived there with the chickens, since infancy. The ten-year old''s long hair was matted with filth; he ate at the chicken trough; roosted with the flock; his fingernails had grown, fittingly, to semicircular claws; he made chicken-like noises, not surprisingly; he had no speech and showed no promise of learning any in the time he survived his rescue.<br/><br/>Forty years ago there was interest in two feral children found in India. They had apparently been raised  by  wolves.  They  were  taken  from  an  actual  wolf  den  along  with  some  cubs,  the  older wolves scattering or being killed. One of the children, Kamala they called her, survived for nine years. Only with difficulty was she taught table manners and such niceties as walking on the hind legs. Nevertheless she exhibited a growing awareness of the reward system of her new group, and displayed  a  strong  drive  toward  such  orientation.  As  with  the  chicken-child,  however,  she  had missed  the  formatives  period  of  human  infant  development,  and  there  was  no  easy or  complete going  back  to  retrace  the  steps.  Kamala  had  formed  according  to  the  pattern  eliciting  response around  her  during  her  mirroring  period.  For  her  first  two  years  of  captivity-or  rescue-she howled  faithfully at  ten,  twelve,  and  three  at  night,  as  all  Indian  wolves  do.  She  would  also,  in spite of precautions, manage to get at the chickens, rip them apart alive and eat them raw. Only when the new social reward  system grew strong enough to outweigh the earlier rewards did she abandon her early training.<br/><br/> What kind of minds did these feral children have? Jung claimed that no one is born a tabula rasa, a blank slate. As the body carries features specifically human yet individually varied, so does the psychic  organism.  The  psyche  preserves  an  unconscious  stratum  of  elements  going  back  to  the invertebrates and ultimately the protozoa. Jung speaks of a hypothetical peeling of the collective unconscious, layer by layer, down to the psychology of the amoeba. We can trace a rough parallel in the development of the foetus.<br/><br/>As  the  body  must  be  fed  to  realize  the  potential  built  in  to  the  genes  as  a  blueprint  waiting development, so must the mind. Jung used the term archetype to describe "recurrent impressions made  by  subjective  reactions."  We  inherit  such  ideas  as  part  of  our  potential  mind  pattern. Archetypes, however,  are only a kind  of readiness to produce over and again the same mythical ideas.  If  the  readiness  is  not  triggered  by  a  response  or  a  demand,  that  particular  possibility remains dormant and even steadily diminishes.<br/><br/>Linguists  are  intrigued  by  the  readiness  with  which  the  infant  seizes  a  language,  if  given  the referents. The "readiness" of language can miscarry, as Susanne Langer put it, because of lack of the trigger-response interplay. If this happens, the world view shaped by that language miscarries too  and  never  forms.  Then  participation  in  that  kind  of  world  is  permanently blocked.  Leonard Hall  writes  that  our  culture  and  our  reality  are  not  separate  phenomena.  People  of  different cultures not only speak different languages, but inherit different sensory worlds.<br/><br/>Levi-Strauss uses the term "semantic-universe" to describe our intellectual-scientific-technological fabric  of  reality.  Jerome  Bruner  suggested  that  language  is  our  most  powerful  means  for performing  "transformations"  on  the  world.  We  transmute  the  world''s  shape  by  metaphoric mutations. We recombine our verbal structures in the interest of new possibilities.<br/><br/>Susanne Langer considered language to be conception and concept the frame of perception. Thus, for Langer, we live in a "primary world" of reality that is verbal. The word for a thing helps to arrest an infant''s visual process and focus it on a specific thing. It is the combination of sensory possibilities, parental focus, and innate drives for ordering, that organizes the child''s visual field. Then  the  word-thing  growth  becomes  exponential,  growing  like  a  tree  at  every  tip.  Grouping, identifying,  correlating,  with  a  constant  check  with  his  exemplars,  gives  the  young  child  an exciting  participation  and  communion,  a  defining  of  self  and  world.  Langer  calls  even  nature  a "language-made  affair,"  made  for  understanding,  and  "prone  to  collapse  in  to  chaos  if  ideation fails."

A mind  finds  its definition  of  itself  not  by confrontation  with  things  so  much  as  other  minds.  We  are  shaped  by each other. We adjust not to the reality of a world but to the reality of other thinkers. When we have finally persuaded and/or badgered our children in to "looking objectively" at their situation, taking in to consideration those things other to themselves, we relax since they are being realistic. What  we  mean  is  that  they  have  finally  begun  to  mirror  our  commitments,  verify  our  life investments, and strengthen and preserve the cosmic egg of our culture.<br/><br/>Occasionally we hear of people found chained in attics and such places from infancy. Their world view is either scanty or different for they are always feeble minded at best. In 1951 a child was found in an Irish chicken house, having somehow survived there with the chickens, since infancy. The ten-year old''s long hair was matted with filth; he ate at the chicken trough; roosted with the flock; his fingernails had grown, fittingly, to semicircular claws; he made chicken-like noises, not surprisingly; he had no speech and showed no promise of learning any in the time he survived his rescue.<br/><br/>Forty years ago there was interest in two feral children found in India. They had apparently been raised  by  wolves.  They  were  taken  from  an  actual  wolf  den  along  with  some  cubs,  the  older wolves scattering or being killed. One of the children, Kamala they called her, survived for nine years. Only with difficulty was she taught table manners and such niceties as walking on the hind legs. Nevertheless she exhibited a growing awareness of the reward system of her new group, and displayed  a  strong  drive  toward  such  orientation.  As  with  the  chicken-child,  however,  she  had missed  the  formatives  period  of  human  infant  development,  and  there  was  no  easy or  complete going  back  to  retrace  the  steps.  Kamala  had  formed  according  to  the  pattern  eliciting  response around  her  during  her  mirroring  period.  For  her  first  two  years  of  captivity-or  rescue-she howled  faithfully at  ten,  twelve,  and  three  at  night,  as  all  Indian  wolves  do.  She  would  also,  in spite of precautions, manage to get at the chickens, rip them apart alive and eat them raw. Only when the new social reward  system grew strong enough to outweigh the earlier rewards did she abandon her early training.<br/><br/> What kind of minds did these feral children have? Jung claimed that no one is born a tabula rasa, a blank slate. As the body carries features specifically human yet individually varied, so does the psychic  organism.  The  psyche  preserves  an  unconscious  stratum  of  elements  going  back  to  the invertebrates and ultimately the protozoa. Jung speaks of a hypothetical peeling of the collective unconscious, layer by layer, down to the psychology of the amoeba. We can trace a rough parallel in the development of the foetus.<br/><br/>As  the  body  must  be  fed  to  realize  the  potential  built  in  to  the  genes  as  a  blueprint  waiting development, so must the mind. Jung used the term archetype to describe "recurrent impressions made  by  subjective  reactions."  We  inherit  such  ideas  as  part  of  our  potential  mind  pattern. Archetypes, however,  are only a kind  of readiness to produce over and again the same mythical ideas.  If  the  readiness  is  not  triggered  by  a  response  or  a  demand,  that  particular  possibility remains dormant and even steadily diminishes.<br/><br/>Linguists  are  intrigued  by  the  readiness  with  which  the  infant  seizes  a  language,  if  given  the referents. The "readiness" of language can miscarry, as Susanne Langer put it, because of lack of the trigger-response interplay. If this happens, the world view shaped by that language miscarries too  and  never  forms.  Then  participation  in  that  kind  of  world  is  permanently blocked.  Leonard Hall  writes  that  our  culture  and  our  reality  are  not  separate  phenomena.  People  of  different cultures not only speak different languages, but inherit different sensory worlds.<br/><br/>Levi-Strauss uses the term "semantic-universe" to describe our intellectual-scientific-technological fabric  of  reality.  Jerome  Bruner  suggested  that  language  is  our  most  powerful  means  for performing  "transformations"  on  the  world.  We  transmute  the  world''s  shape  by  metaphoric mutations. We recombine our verbal structures in the interest of new possibilities.<br/><br/>Susanne Langer considered language to be conception and concept the frame of perception. Thus, for Langer, we live in a "primary world" of reality that is verbal. The word for a thing helps to arrest an infant''s visual process and focus it on a specific thing.

Men of science have differed  as to their responsibility for such effects.   Some have said that the function of the scientist in society is to supply knowledge, and that he need not concern  himself  with  the  use  to  which  this  knowledge  is  put.   I  do  not  think  that  this  view  is tenable, especially in our age.   The scientist is also a citizen; and citizens who have any special skill have a public duty to see, as far as they can, that their skill is utilised in accordance with the public  interest. Historically,  the  functions  of  the  scientists  in  public  life  have  generally  been recognised.  The Royal Society was founded by Charles II as an antidote to ''fanaticism'' which had plunged England into a long period of civil strife. The scientists of that time did not hesitate to speak out on public issues, such as religious toleration and the folly of prosecutions for witchcraft. But  although  science  has,  in  various  ways  at  various  times,  favoured  what  may  be  called  a humanitarian  outlook,  it  has  from  the  first  had  an  intimate  and  sinister  connection  with  war. Archimedes sold his skill to the Tyrant of Syracuse for use against the Romans; Leonardo secured a salary from the Duke of Milan for his skill in the art of fortification; and Galileo got employment under the Grand Duke of Tuscany because he could calculate the trajectories of projectiles.  In the French Revolution the scientists who were not guillotined were set to making new explosives, but Lavoisier  was  not  spared,  because  he  was  only discovering  hydrogen which,  in those days,  was not  a  weapon  of  war. There  have  been  some  honourable  exceptions  to  the  subservience  of scientists to warmongers. During the Crimean War, the British Government consulted Faraday as to the feasibility of attack by poisonous gases. Faraday replied that it was entirely feasible, but that it was inhuman and he would have nothing to do with it.<br/><br/>Modern democracy and modern methods of publicity have made the problem of affecting public opinion quite different from what it used to be.   The knowledge that the public possesses on any important issue is derived from vast and powerful organisations; the press, radio, and above all, television. The knowledge that Governments possess is more limited. They are too busy to search out the facts for  themselves,  and  consequently they know only what their  underlings think good for  them  unless  there  is  such  a  powerful  movement  in  a  different  sense  that  politicians  cannot ignore it.   Facts which ought to guide the decisions of statesmen - for instance, as to the possible lethal qualities of  fall-out - do not acquire their due importance if they remain buried in scientific journals. They acquire their due importance only when they become known to so many voters that they affect the course of the elections.  In general,  there is a widespread opposition by public to such  facts.  This  opposition  springs  from  various  sources,  some  sinister,  some  comparatively respectable. At the bottom of the moral scale there is the financial interest of the various industries connected  with armaments. Then there are various effects of a somewhat thoughtless patriotism, which  believes  in  secrecy  and  in  what  is  called  ''toughness.''  But  perhaps  more  important  than either  of  these  is  the  unpleasantness  of  the  facts,  which makes the general public turn aside the pleasanter topics such as divorces and murders. The consequence is that what ought to be known widely  throughout  the  general  public  will  not  be  known  unless  great  efforts  are  made  by disinterested persons to see that the information reaches the minds and hearts of vast numbers of people.   I do not think this work can be successfully accomplished except by the help of men of science.  They,  alone,  can  speak  with  the  authority  that  is  necessary  to  combat  the  misleading statements  of  those  scientists  who  have  permitted  themselves  to  become  merchants  of  death.  If disinterested   scientists   do   not   speak   out,   the   others   will   succeed   in   conveying   distorted impressions, not only to the public but also to the politicians.<br/><br/>It must be admitted that there are obstacles to individual action in our age which did not exist at earlier  times.  Galileo  could  make  his  own  telescope.    But  once  when  I  was  talking  to  a  very famous  astronomer  he  explained  that  the  telescope  upon  which  his  work  depended  owed  its existence to the benefactions of enormously rich men, and, if he had not stood well with them, his astronomical discoveries would have been impossible.   More frequently, a scientist only acquires access to enormously expensive equipment if he stands well with the government of his country. He knows that if he adopts a rebellious attitude he and his family are likely to perish along with the rest of civilised mankind.   It is a tragic dilemma, and I do not think that one should censure a man whatever his decision; but I do think and I think men of science should realise -   that unless something rather drastic is done under the leadership or through the inspiration of some part of the scientific  world,  the  human  race,  like  the  Gadarene  swine,  will  rush  down  a  steep  place  to destruction in blind ignorance of the facts that scientific skill has prepared for it.<br/><br/>It is impossible in the modern world for a man of science to say with any honesty, ''My business is to  provide  knowledge,  and  what  use  is  made  of  the  knowledge  is  not  my  responsibility.''  The knowledge that a man of science provides may fall into the hands of men or institutions devoted to utterly unworthy objects.   I do not suggest that a man of science, or even a large body of men of science, can altogether prevent this, but they can diminish the magnitude of the evil.<br/><br/>There is another direction in which men of science can attempt to provide leadership.   They can suggest  and  urge  in  many  ways  the  value  of  those  branches  of  science  of  which  the  important practical  uses  are  beneficial  and  not  harmful. Consider  what  might  be  done  if  the  money  at present spent on armaments were spent on increasing and distributing the food supply of the world and diminishing the population pressure.   In a few decades, poverty and malnutrition, which now afflict  more  than  half  the  population  of  the  globe,  could  be  ended.   But  at  present  almost  all governments of great states consider that it is better to spend money on killing foreigners than on keeping  their  own  subjects  alive.   Possibilities  of  a  hopeful  sort  in  whatever  field  can  best  be worked out and stated authoritatively by men of science; and, since they can do this work better than others, it is part of their duty to do it.<br/><br/>As  the  world  becomes  more  technically  unified,  life  in  an  ivory  tower  becomes  increasingly impossible.  Not only so; the man who stands out against the powerful organisations which control most  of  human  activity is apt to  find  himself no  longer  in the ivory tower,  with a wide outlook over  a  sunny landscape,  but  in  the  dark  and  subterranean dungeon upon which the ivory tower, was erected.   To risk such a habitation demands courage.   It will not be necessary to inhabit the dungeon if there are many who are willing to risk it, for everybody knows that the modern world depends  upon  scientists,  and,  if  they  are  insistent,  they  must  be  listened  to.   We  have  it  in  our power to make a good world; and, therefore, with whatever labour and risk, we must make it.<br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[3]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[The  writer  says  that  people  turn  to  ''divorce''  and  ''murder''  as  pleasanter  topics  than  scientific facts because]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[they don''t understand scientific facts.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[they are not ready to face scientific facts.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[''divorce'' and ''murder'' are more sensational.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[they are unwilling to think.]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section 3 - Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[<b>Section 3</b><br/><br/>Passage 3<br/><br/> Science, ever since it first existed, has had important effects in matters that lie outside the purview of pure science.

Men of science have differed  as to their responsibility for such effects.   Some have said that the function of the scientist in society is to supply knowledge, and that he need not concern  himself  with  the  use  to  which  this  knowledge  is  put.   I  do  not  think  that  this  view  is tenable, especially in our age.   The scientist is also a citizen; and citizens who have any special skill have a public duty to see, as far as they can, that their skill is utilised in accordance with the public  interest. Historically,  the  functions  of  the  scientists  in  public  life  have  generally  been recognised.  The Royal Society was founded by Charles II as an antidote to ''fanaticism'' which had plunged England into a long period of civil strife. The scientists of that time did not hesitate to speak out on public issues, such as religious toleration and the folly of prosecutions for witchcraft. But  although  science  has,  in  various  ways  at  various  times,  favoured  what  may  be  called  a humanitarian  outlook,  it  has  from  the  first  had  an  intimate  and  sinister  connection  with  war. Archimedes sold his skill to the Tyrant of Syracuse for use against the Romans; Leonardo secured a salary from the Duke of Milan for his skill in the art of fortification; and Galileo got employment under the Grand Duke of Tuscany because he could calculate the trajectories of projectiles.  In the French Revolution the scientists who were not guillotined were set to making new explosives, but Lavoisier  was  not  spared,  because  he  was  only discovering  hydrogen which,  in those days,  was not  a  weapon  of  war. There  have  been  some  honourable  exceptions  to  the  subservience  of scientists to warmongers. During the Crimean War, the British Government consulted Faraday as to the feasibility of attack by poisonous gases. Faraday replied that it was entirely feasible, but that it was inhuman and he would have nothing to do with it.<br/><br/>Modern democracy and modern methods of publicity have made the problem of affecting public opinion quite different from what it used to be.   The knowledge that the public possesses on any important issue is derived from vast and powerful organisations; the press, radio, and above all, television. The knowledge that Governments possess is more limited. They are too busy to search out the facts for  themselves,  and  consequently they know only what their  underlings think good for  them  unless  there  is  such  a  powerful  movement  in  a  different  sense  that  politicians  cannot ignore it.   Facts which ought to guide the decisions of statesmen - for instance, as to the possible lethal qualities of  fall-out - do not acquire their due importance if they remain buried in scientific journals. They acquire their due importance only when they become known to so many voters that they affect the course of the elections.  In general,  there is a widespread opposition by public to such  facts.  This  opposition  springs  from  various  sources,  some  sinister,  some  comparatively respectable. At the bottom of the moral scale there is the financial interest of the various industries connected  with armaments. Then there are various effects of a somewhat thoughtless patriotism, which  believes  in  secrecy  and  in  what  is  called  ''toughness.''  But  perhaps  more  important  than either  of  these  is  the  unpleasantness  of  the  facts,  which makes the general public turn aside the pleasanter topics such as divorces and murders. The consequence is that what ought to be known widely  throughout  the  general  public  will  not  be  known  unless  great  efforts  are  made  by disinterested persons to see that the information reaches the minds and hearts of vast numbers of people.   I do not think this work can be successfully accomplished except by the help of men of science.  They,  alone,  can  speak  with  the  authority  that  is  necessary  to  combat  the  misleading statements  of  those  scientists  who  have  permitted  themselves  to  become  merchants  of  death.  If disinterested   scientists   do   not   speak   out,   the   others   will   succeed   in   conveying   distorted impressions, not only to the public but also to the politicians.<br/><br/>It must be admitted that there are obstacles to individual action in our age which did not exist at earlier  times.  Galileo  could  make  his  own  telescope.    But  once  when  I  was  talking  to  a  very famous  astronomer  he  explained  that  the  telescope  upon  which  his  work  depended  owed  its existence to the benefactions of enormously rich men, and, if he had not stood well with them, his astronomical discoveries would have been impossible.   More frequently, a scientist only acquires access to enormously expensive equipment if he stands well with the government of his country. He knows that if he adopts a rebellious attitude he and his family are likely to perish along with the rest of civilised mankind.   It is a tragic dilemma, and I do not think that one should censure a man whatever his decision; but I do think and I think men of science should realise -   that unless something rather drastic is done under the leadership or through the inspiration of some part of the scientific  world,  the  human  race,  like  the  Gadarene  swine,  will  rush  down  a  steep  place  to destruction in blind ignorance of the facts that scientific skill has prepared for it.<br/><br/>It is impossible in the modern world for a man of science to say with any honesty, ''My business is to  provide  knowledge,  and  what  use  is  made  of  the  knowledge  is  not  my  responsibility.''

Yet it is a sobering thought that, in these last five decades, we have become more conscious than ever of what divides us: religion, region, caste, language, ethnicity. The singular thing about India, as I wrote in India: From Midriightto the Millennium, is that you can only speak of it in the plural. What makes us, then, a nation?<br/><br/>Let me risk the wrath of anti-Congress readers and take an Italian example, No, not that Italian example, but one from 140 years ago. Amidst the popular ferment that made an Italian nation out of a congeries of principalities and statelets, the 19th-century novelist Massimo Taparelli d''Azeglio memorably wrote, "We have created Italy. Now all we need to do is to create Italians." Oddly enough, no Indian nationalist succumbed to the temptation to express the same thought - "We have created India; now all we need to do is to create Indians."<br/><br/>Such a sentiment would not, in any case, have occurred to the pre-eminent voice of Indian nationalism, Jawaharlal Nehru, because he believed in the existence of India and Indians for millennia before he gave words to their longings; he would never have spoken of ''creating'' India or Indians, merely of being the agent for the reassertion of what had always existed but had been long suppressed. Nonetheless, the India that was born in 1947 was in a very real sense a new creation: a state that had made fellow citizens of the Ladakhi and the Laccadivian for the first time, that divided Punjabi from Punjabi for the first time, that asked the Kerala peasant to feel allegiance to a Kashmiri Pandit, ruling in Delhi, also for the first time. Nehru would not have written of the challenge of ''creating'' Indians, but creating Indians was what, in fact, our nationalist movement did.<br/><br/>Indian nationalism is a rare animal indeed. It is not based on language (since we have at least 17 or 35, depending on whether you follow the Constitution or the ethnolinguists), geography (the ''natural'' frontiers of the subcontinent - the mountains and the sea - have been hacked by the partition of 1947), ethnicity (the ''Indian'' accommodates a diversity of racial types in which many Indians have more in common with foreigners than with other Indians) or religion (we are home to every faith known to man, and Hinduism - a faith without a national organization, no established church or ecclesiastical hierarchy, no uniform beliefs or modes of worship - exemplifies as much our diversity as it does our common cultural heritage). As I have written elsewhere, we are minorities in India. Indian nationalism is the nationalism of an idea, the idea of an ever-ever land.<br/><br/>This land imposes no procrustean exactions on its citizens: you can be many things and one thing. You can be a good Muslim, a good Keralite and a good Indian all at once. Our founding fathers wrote a constitution for a dream; we have given passports to our ideals. Where Freudians note the distinctions that arise out of ''the narcissism of minor differences'', in India we celebrate the commonality of major differences. To borrow Michael Ignatieffs famous phrase, we are a land of belonging rather than of blood.<br/><br/>Most modern nations are the product of a fusion of population groups over the centuries, to the point where one element is indistinguishable from the next. The 19th-century French historian Ernest Renan pointed out, for instance, that ''an Englishman is indeed a type within the whole of humanity. However, [he].. is neither the Briton of Julius Caesar''s time, nor the Anglo-Saxon of Hengist''s time, nor the Dane of Canute''s time, nor the Norman of William the Conqueror''s time; [he] is rather the result of all these''. We cannot yet say the same of an Indian, because we are not yet the product of the kind of fusion that Renan''s Englishman represents: despite some inter-marriage at the elite levels in the cities, Indians still largely remain endogamous, and a Bengali is easily distinguished from a Punjabi.<br/><br/>So India cannot claim ethnicity as a uniting factor, since what we loosely have in common with each other as a generally recognizable ''type'' we also have in common with Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, Maldivians and Nepalese, with whom we do not share a common political identity. (And further distinctions make matters worse - after all, ethnically, Indian Bengalis and Punjabis have far more in common with Bangladeshis and Pakistanis than with Bangaloreans and Poona wallahs.). Nor can we cite religion. Looking again at foreign models of the nation-state, many scholars have pointed out that the adoption of Christianity by both conquerors and the conquered helped the creation of the Western European nations, since it eliminated the distinction between ethnic groups in the society on the basis of their religion. But this is not a useful answer in India, for a Tamil Hindu can share a faith with a Haryanvi Jat and still feel he has nothing in common with him. And equally important, nearly 200 million Indians do not share the faith of the majority, and would be excluded from any religiously-defined community (as non-Christian minorities amongst immigrants in Europe feel excluded today from full acceptance into their new societies).<br/><br/>A third element that has, historically, served to unite nations in other parts of the world is language. In Europe, conquerors and the conquered rapidly came to speak the same language, usually that of the conquered. In India, attempts by Muslim conquerors to import Persian or Turkic languages nevertook root and, instead, the hybrid camp language called Urdu or Hindustani evolved as the language of both rulers and the ruled in most of North India. But Hindi today has made very limited inroads into the south, east and north-east. So linguistic unity remains a distant prospect (all the more so given that languages like Bengali, Malayalam and Tamil have a far richer cultural and literary tradition than the Hindi which seeks to supplant them).Language and religion are, in any case, an inadequate basis for nationhood. Over 80 countries profess Christianity, but they do not seek to merge with each other; the Organization of the Islamic Conference has more than 50 members, who agree on many issues but do not see themselves as a single nation. As for language, Arabic makes meetings of the Arab League more convenient, no doubt, but has hardly been a force for political unity. Spanish has not melted the political frontiers that vivisect Latin America; and England and the United States remain, in the famous phrase, two countries divided by a common language.<br/><br/>A more poetic suggestion made by the French historian Ernest Renan is that historical amnesia is an essential part of nation-building, that nations are those which have forgotten the price they have paid in the past for their unity. This is true of India, though the Babri Masjid tragedy reveals that we Indians are not very good at forgetting. We carry with us the weight of the past, and because we do not have a finely-developed sense of historicism, it is a past that is still alive in our present. We wear the dust of history on our foreheads and the mud of the future on our feet.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what matters in determining the validity of a nation is the will of its inhabitants to live and strive together.<br/><br/>Such a will may not be unanimous, for there will always be those who reject the common framework for narrow sectarian ends. But if the overwhelming majority of the people share the political will for unity, if they can look back to both a past and a future, and if they realize they are better off in Kozhikode or Kanpur dreaming the same dreams as those in Kolhapur or Kohima, a nation exists, celebrating diversity and freedom. That is the India that has emerged in the last 54 years, and it is well worth celebrating.<br/><br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[1]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[.

However, [he].. is neither the Briton of Julius Caesar''s time, nor the Anglo-Saxon of Hengist''s time, nor the Dane of Canute''s time, nor the Norman of William the Conqueror''s time; [he] is rather the result of all these''. We cannot yet say the same of an Indian, because we are not yet the product of the kind of fusion that Renan''s Englishman represents: despite some inter-marriage at the elite levels in the cities, Indians still largely remain endogamous, and a Bengali is easily distinguished from a Punjabi.<br/><br/>So India cannot claim ethnicity as a uniting factor, since what we loosely have in common with each other as a generally recognizable ''type'' we also have in common with Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, Maldivians and Nepalese, with whom we do not share a common political identity. (And further distinctions make matters worse - after all, ethnically, Indian Bengalis and Punjabis have far more in common with Bangladeshis and Pakistanis than with Bangaloreans and Poona wallahs.). Nor can we cite religion. Looking again at foreign models of the nation-state, many scholars have pointed out that the adoption of Christianity by both conquerors and the conquered helped the creation of the Western European nations, since it eliminated the distinction between ethnic groups in the society on the basis of their religion. But this is not a useful answer in India, for a Tamil Hindu can share a faith with a Haryanvi Jat and still feel he has nothing in common with him.

In Europe, conquerors and the conquered rapidly came to speak the same language, usually that of the conquered. In India, attempts by Muslim conquerors to import Persian or Turkic languages nevertook root and, instead, the hybrid camp language called Urdu or Hindustani evolved as the language of both rulers and the ruled in most of North India. But Hindi today has made very limited inroads into the south, east and north-east. So linguistic unity remains a distant prospect (all the more so given that languages like Bengali, Malayalam and Tamil have a far richer cultural and literary tradition than the Hindi which seeks to supplant them).Language and religion are, in any case, an inadequate basis for nationhood. Over 80 countries profess Christianity, but they do not seek to merge with each other; the Organization of the Islamic Conference has more than 50 members, who agree on many issues but do not see themselves as a single nation. As for language, Arabic makes meetings of the Arab League more convenient, no doubt, but has hardly been a force for political unity.

Yet it is a sobering thought that, in these last five decades, we have become more conscious than ever of what divides us: religion, region, caste, language, ethnicity. The singular thing about India, as I wrote in India: From Midriightto the Millennium, is that you can only speak of it in the plural. What makes us, then, a nation?<br/><br/>Let me risk the wrath of anti-Congress readers and take an Italian example, No, not that Italian example, but one from 140 years ago. Amidst the popular ferment that made an Italian nation out of a congeries of principalities and statelets, the 19th-century novelist Massimo Taparelli d''Azeglio memorably wrote, "We have created Italy. Now all we need to do is to create Italians." Oddly enough, no Indian nationalist succumbed to the temptation to express the same thought - "We have created India; now all we need to do is to create Indians."<br/><br/>Such a sentiment would not, in any case, have occurred to the pre-eminent voice of Indian nationalism, Jawaharlal Nehru, because he believed in the existence of India and Indians for millennia before he gave words to their longings; he would never have spoken of ''creating'' India or Indians, merely of being the agent for the reassertion of what had always existed but had been long suppressed. Nonetheless, the India that was born in 1947 was in a very real sense a new creation: a state that had made fellow citizens of the Ladakhi and the Laccadivian for the first time, that divided Punjabi from Punjabi for the first time, that asked the Kerala peasant to feel allegiance to a Kashmiri Pandit, ruling in Delhi, also for the first time. Nehru would not have written of the challenge of ''creating'' Indians, but creating Indians was what, in fact, our nationalist movement did.<br/><br/>Indian nationalism is a rare animal indeed. It is not based on language (since we have at least 17 or 35, depending on whether you follow the Constitution or the ethnolinguists), geography (the ''natural'' frontiers of the subcontinent - the mountains and the sea - have been hacked by the partition of 1947), ethnicity (the ''Indian'' accommodates a diversity of racial types in which many Indians have more in common with foreigners than with other Indians) or religion (we are home to every faith known to man, and Hinduism - a faith without a national organization, no established church or ecclesiastical hierarchy, no uniform beliefs or modes of worship - exemplifies as much our diversity as it does our common cultural heritage).

"Is it really so hard to believe?" Morpheus replies. Not for Ed Fredkin. He too claims the universe we perceive is a computer program. To be precise, it is the kind of program known as a cellular automaton, in which patterns form and evolve on a grid according to a simple rule. If only we can figure out the right kind of grid and the right rule, says Fredkin, we should be able to model the universe, and all of physics.<br/><br/>Fredkin, who is a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has already produced cellular automata in which clusters of bits move and behave in a way that resembles electrons and photons. He is convinced that all the particles and forces in the universe can be modelled in the same way. As Fredkin sees it, this is not just a simulation like the computer-generated world in which Neo and Morpheus found themselves, but the real thing. While mainstream physics turns to abstract concepts like particles and fields to describe the behaviour of the matter and energy that make up the universe, Fredkin says they are formed from a pattern of bits. Cosmology is simply the repeated application of the rule that governs how the pattern evolves. The universe''s program is just a few lines of clean and elegant code.<br/><br/>Cellular automata of one kind or another date back decades. Perhaps the most famous is John Conway''s 1970 Game of Life, which starts with a grid of squares or ''cells''. Some of the cells selected at random are filled, and are represented by a binary 1, while the rest remain empty and are represented by 0. The game proceeds step by step: at each step some of the cells flip from 1 to 0, or vice versa, depending on which of its neighbouring cells are filled, and the rules are formulated in such a way that patterns sometimes emerge which appear almost to be alive.Like Conway''s Game of Life, Fredkin''s model of physics consists of bits - units of binary information - plus a grid for them to inhabit. The cellular automaton is like a loom in which the long threads, or warp, correspond to time and form the framework upon which the weaving will take place line by line. At each time-step, a cross-thread of the tapestry of the universe is laid down. Where the cross-thread crosses the warp, it has two possibilities over or under. It''s a binary decision, to be made anew as each line of the weaving unfolds. So, for example, if the whole universe could be described by six bits of information, there would be six warp threads along which two-dimensional patterns of is and Os would build up as the weaving progresses step by step.<br/><br/>The patterns become more obvious if colour is added. If the warp threads are black and the weft thread is white, then each point where the thread goes under will result in a black cell represented by a 0 bit; points where the thread passes over will show as 1 bit. The final weaving should look like a blotchy pattern of black and white cells, the history of the universe produced by the patterning of evolving cellular automata.<br/><br/>The way the automata evolve is controlled by a rule - or as Fredkin calls it, the Rule, with a capital R. The Rule applies to every single cell in the grid and it stipulates whether the state will change at the next timestep, depending on the states of neighbouring cells. Essentially, the Rule is a look-up table that relates changes in the state of a cell to the states of nearby cells at an earlier time. The table can be converted into a string of bits that is a single whole number, a constant that Fredkin calls A. The simplest example of a rule might be this: if an odd number of the three bits directly and diagonally above a bit are 1 (thread is above), then a bit will become 0 (thread below); if the number is even, it becomes 1.<br/><br/>If this all sounds vaguely familiar, that might be because Stephen Wolfram, who has had occasional discussions with Fredkin about these concepts over the years, last year published a book that includes some similar sounding ideas. In A New Kind of Science, Wolfram gave countless examples of starkly simple rules generating astoundingly complex patterns that mimic those found in nature. In Wolfram''s simple two-dimensional grids, a range of entirely different patterns could emerge depending on which of 256 possible rues were applied. Wolfram, in fact, was initially sceptical of the applicability of cellular automata to a fundamental theory of physics when Fredkin first described the idea on a visit Wolfram made to the MIT Lab for Computer Science. According to his spokeswoman, Wolfram is still sceptical.<br/><br/>Today, the automata Fredkin builds are far more ambitious. He works in a three dimensional space in which the state of each point is determined by the state of nearest neighbours in the previous time-steps.<br/><br/>So how does physics itself come out of this model? The most basic unit of motion is for two cells to swap their contents. Fredkin defines mass to be a form of information in his model, so swapping two bits constitutes motion, or a change in momentum. The conservation of momentum is something that has to be respected by the Rule: no matter how bits move in the grid, the total amount of momentum must remain unchanged.<br/><br/>The most basic unit of energy is nearly as simple. It is the swapping of cells in different states. So if a black cell is followed by a white one and a white cell by a black one, then action is taking place and therefore energy is involved. This may sound contrived, but in mainstream physics the concept of energy as ''doing work'' is a much vaguer definition. Just as with conservation of momentum, the Rule ensures that even when action takes place, the total amount of energy is conserved.<br/><br/>Everything builds up from this simple level. In his newest version, Fredkin sets initial conditions for patterns of bits that have some of the properties of photons and electrons in empty space. A subatomic particle is just a pattern of many bits of information that travel through the grid together ''sort of like a swarm of gnats'', as Fredkin puts it. In his model, a swarm of several hundred bits is enough to make up a photon or electron.<br/><br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[4]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[Fredkin''s theory differs from Neo''s and Morpheus''s world in the sense that]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[in Neo''s world, the universe is like a computer program, but for Fredkin patterns form and evolve on a grid according to a simple rule.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Both feel that the world is like a computer program, but Fredkin''s theory suggests how we can model the world, whereas Neo''s world suggests how we can understand it.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[The computer generated world of Neo is only a simulation whereas Fredkin''s model claims to be the real one.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[None of these]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section III - Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[PASSAGE - II<br/><br/>"Right now, we''re inside a computer program?" asks Neo in the movie The Matrix.

In A New Kind of Science, Wolfram gave countless examples of starkly simple rules generating astoundingly complex patterns that mimic those found in nature. In Wolfram''s simple two-dimensional grids, a range of entirely different patterns could emerge depending on which of 256 possible rues were applied. Wolfram, in fact, was initially sceptical of the applicability of cellular automata to a fundamental theory of physics when Fredkin first described the idea on a visit Wolfram made to the MIT Lab for Computer Science.

The most basic unit of motion is for two cells to swap their contents. Fredkin defines mass to be a form of information in his model, so swapping two bits constitutes motion, or a change in momentum. The conservation of momentum is something that has to be respected by the Rule: no matter how bits move in the grid, the total amount of momentum must remain unchanged.<br/><br/>The most basic unit of energy is nearly as simple. It is the swapping of cells in different states. So if a black cell is followed by a white one and a white cell by a black one, then action is taking place and therefore energy is involved. This may sound contrived, but in mainstream physics the concept of energy as ''doing work'' is a much vaguer definition. Just as with conservation of momentum, the Rule ensures that even when action takes place, the total amount of energy is conserved.<br/><br/>Everything builds up from this simple level. In his newest version, Fredkin sets initial conditions for patterns of bits that have some of the properties of photons and electrons in empty space. A subatomic particle is just a pattern of many bits of information that travel through the grid together ''sort of like a swarm of gnats'', as Fredkin puts it. In his model, a swarm of several hundred bits is enough to make up a photon or electron.<br/><br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[3]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[According to the author, the cellular automaton]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[is not very easily applicable to a fundamental theory of physics.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[work only in a three-dimensional space.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[is bits moving and behaving in a way resembling electrons and photons.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[is a program in which patterns form and move in a grid according to a simple rule.]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section III - Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[PASSAGE - II<br/><br/>"Right now, we''re inside a computer program?" asks Neo in the movie The Matrix. "Is it really so hard to believe?" Morpheus replies. Not for Ed Fredkin. He too claims the universe we perceive is a computer program. To be precise, it is the kind of program known as a cellular automaton, in which patterns form and evolve on a grid according to a simple rule. If only we can figure out the right kind of grid and the right rule, says Fredkin, we should be able to model the universe, and all of physics.<br/><br/>Fredkin, who is a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has already produced cellular automata in which clusters of bits move and behave in a way that resembles electrons and photons. He is convinced that all the particles and forces in the universe can be modelled in the same way. As Fredkin sees it, this is not just a simulation like the computer-generated world in which Neo and Morpheus found themselves, but the real thing. While mainstream physics turns to abstract concepts like particles and fields to describe the behaviour of the matter and energy that make up the universe, Fredkin says they are formed from a pattern of bits. Cosmology is simply the repeated application of the rule that governs how the pattern evolves. The universe''s program is just a few lines of clean and elegant code.<br/><br/>Cellular automata of one kind or another date back decades. Perhaps the most famous is John Conway''s 1970 Game of Life, which starts with a grid of squares or ''cells''. Some of the cells selected at random are filled, and are represented by a binary 1, while the rest remain empty and are represented by 0. The game proceeds step by step: at each step some of the cells flip from 1 to 0, or vice versa, depending on which of its neighbouring cells are filled, and the rules are formulated in such a way that patterns sometimes emerge which appear almost to be alive.Like Conway''s Game of Life, Fredkin''s model of physics consists of bits - units of binary information - plus a grid for them to inhabit. The cellular automaton is like a loom in which the long threads, or warp, correspond to time and form the framework upon which the weaving will take place line by line. At each time-step, a cross-thread of the tapestry of the universe is laid down. Where the cross-thread crosses the warp, it has two possibilities over or under. It''s a binary decision, to be made anew as each line of the weaving unfolds. So, for example, if the whole universe could be described by six bits of information, there would be six warp threads along which two-dimensional patterns of is and Os would build up as the weaving progresses step by step.<br/><br/>The patterns become more obvious if colour is added. If the warp threads are black and the weft thread is white, then each point where the thread goes under will result in a black cell represented by a 0 bit; points where the thread passes over will show as 1 bit. The final weaving should look like a blotchy pattern of black and white cells, the history of the universe produced by the patterning of evolving cellular automata.<br/><br/>The way the automata evolve is controlled by a rule - or as Fredkin calls it, the Rule, with a capital R. The Rule applies to every single cell in the grid and it stipulates whether the state will change at the next timestep, depending on the states of neighbouring cells. Essentially, the Rule is a look-up table that relates changes in the state of a cell to the states of nearby cells at an earlier time. The table can be converted into a string of bits that is a single whole number, a constant that Fredkin calls A. The simplest example of a rule might be this: if an odd number of the three bits directly and diagonally above a bit are 1 (thread is above), then a bit will become 0 (thread below); if the number is even, it becomes 1.<br/><br/>If this all sounds vaguely familiar, that might be because Stephen Wolfram, who has had occasional discussions with Fredkin about these concepts over the years, last year published a book that includes some similar sounding ideas.

This has to be with Germany. That has to be a goalless draw. So the score line in third match of Canada was Canada 3 - opponent 0.<br/>6. Canada''s 3-0 is only possible with Pakistan.<br/>7. Germany has won one match, and this has to be against Pakistan. Score line was 3-2. Now all questions can be answered.<br/>]]></Solution>    </question></test>'),

With combination of one 20 box, and then some combinations of 6 and 9, all values which are 1 less than any multiple of 3, starting from 26 to infinity, can be purchased.<br/><br/>With combination of two 20 boxes, and then some combinations of 6 and 9, all values which are 2 less than any multiple of 3, starting from 46 to infinity, can be purchased.<br/><br/>Therefore, Now we can purchase multiples of 3, 1 less than multiple of 3 and 2 less the multiple of 3. Now 3 less than a multiple of 3 would anyway be a multiple of 3. So we have all numbers starting from 46 covered.<br/><br/>45 is a multiple of 3. So counted in 1st  step.<br/>44 is 1 less than a multiple of 3, so counted in 2nd  step.<br/>43 is not counted. So answer = 43.<br/>]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[What is Rajeev''s average speed?]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[42 km/hr ]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[50 km/hr ]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[62 km/hr ]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Indeterminate]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Quantitative Ability]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[Directions  for  Questions  3 and 4:  Answer  the  questions  on  the  basis  of  the  information given below.<br/><br/>Gurgaon and Noida are linked by the Outer Ring Road via Faridabad and by the 80 feet Road via Delhi which is midway between the two places as shown.<br/><br/>Rajeev wants to travel from Gurgaon to Noida and decides to try the 80 feet road.

Charles  de Gaulle had also won that right, and he now faced the question: where should he begin his service? Traditionally, the most prestigious service was cavalry, and last on this scale, as everywhere, was long-suffering infantry. However strange that may seem at first glance, our junior lieutenant chose precisely  the  thankless  lot  of  an  infantryman.  Moreover,  he  decided  to  serve  in  that  very  33rd Infantry Regiment at Arras where he had gone through his service in the ranks. Charles de Gaulle would  always surprise everyone  by his  unexpected decisions,  but this  one  was  not  as  rash  as  it might  seem.  Picturesque cavalry  inevitably  lost its  former  glory  in  the epoch  of  mass  use  of machine-guns  while artillery was  regarded  as  a  kind of  auxiliary service  in  France;  but infantry remained  the  main  striking  force called  upon  to perform  those  really  great  deeds  of  which  de Gaulle dreamed. True, there were also the particularly fashionable Navy and aviation, which was then coming in to being. But these services required highly specialized training.<br/><br/>Born at Lille and linked with the north through his mother''s and grandmother''s origin, he had a longing for the parts where he intended to serve. In character and temperament he was close to the traditions and spirit of the inhabitants of the northern provinces sharply differing from those of the south. Charles de Gaulle was fascinated by the history of France, chiefly by military history, and it was mostly in the north that the great battles had taken place which he knew as if he had fought in them himself. He was convinced that the north would also inevitably be the scene of the battles to come.<br/><br/>Finally, Charles de Gaulle knew, of course, that the newly appointed commander of 33rd  Infantry was Philippe Petain, well known in the army not only for his obstreperousness and frictions with his superiors, which adversely affected  his career, but also for his critical attitude to the official military doctrine. Petain was extremely conservative. Ignoring the new law segregating the church from  the  state,  he  openly  encouraged officers  to  attend  Mass  regularly.  In  any  case  he  had  the reputation  of  an  intelligent,  energetic,  and  exacting  officer  who  could be a  good  teacher  of  the military craft.<br/><br/>The  moment  came  when  the  raw  young  officer,  his  fresh  epaulets  glittering,  reported  to  his colonel.  The  22-year-old  junior  lieutenant,  black  eyed,  very tall,  stood  for  the  first time  face  to face with the 56-year-old  colonel ironically looking at him with his pale blue eyes. De Gaulle''s destiny would for a long time be linked with Petain..<br/><br/>The Young officer who would serve for many years under Colonel (later Marshall) Petain would feel great respect for his patron. It is interesting that even after Petain’s disgrace at the end, when he became France''s traitor, de Gaulle would retain something of that feeling. He would write in his memoir : "My first  colonel, Petain, showed me the meaning of the gift and art of command."<br/><br/>Thus  De  Gaulle  began his  career.  One cannot  say,  however,  that  his  education  was  ended.  His Service as an officer strengthened and deepened some of his character traits. Professional soldiers were a world in itself not only with regard to the nation but also to the variable elements in the army, the men called up for the service in the ranks and reserve officers. The caste spirit was at that time extremely strong in the French army, which largely retained the structure and traditions of the monarchist army despite the numerous attempts of the Republic to democratize it. While it has  proved possible  to  impose  heavy  restriction  on  the church,  this  other  institution  of  the  old regime  was  unshakable.  Officially,  the army  functioned  according  to 1832  law  adopted  under Louis  Philippe.  Even  after  the exposure  of  the  Dreyfus  affair  nothing had  changed; the army remained  a  state  within  state.  Officers  were  encouraged  in  their  feelings  of  disdain  towards civilians  in  general  and  towards  the  deputies,  parliament,  and  the  government  in  particular. Strange as it may seem, the fact that the army had no franchise and was formally outside politics only  served  to  foster  that  contempt  and  to  strengthen  the  officer’s  opposition  to  everything civilian. It is easy to see that this tendency coincided with young de Gaulle''s anti-parliamentarism.<br/><br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[2]]></CorrectOption>    </question></test>');

Suppose two scientists start out by disagreeing greatly about the probable truth of hypothesis h which predicts otherwise unexpected experimental outcome e. The one who attributes a high probability to h will regard e as less unlikely than the one who attributes a low probability to h. So P(e) will be high for the former and low for the latter. Suppose now that e is experimentally confirmed. Each scientist will have to adjust the probabilities for h by the factor P(e/h)/P(e). However, since we are assuming that e follows from h, P(e/h) is 1 and the scaling factor is 1/P(e). Consequently, the scientist who started with a low probability for h will scale up that probability by a larger factor than the scientist who started with a higher probability for h. As more positive evidence comes in, the original doubter is forced to scale up the probability in such a way that it eventually approaches that of the already convinced scientist. In this way, argue the Bayesians, widely differing subjective opinions can be brought into conformity in response to evidence in an objective way.]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[3]]></CorrectOption>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[Strictly following the idea put forward in the article, which one of the following is a logical possibility:]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[The idea that astrologers can predict stock market movements better than economists, if astrologers'' hypothesis (h) is more consistently followed by outcomes (e) than that of economists.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[The fact that stock-market movements are in sync with the movement of the heavenly bodies; both (h) and (e) contained in the same statement.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[That certain astrological phenomena can influence thinking of humans (e) which is manifested in stock-market booms and crashes (h).]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[That certain astrological phenomena (h) can influence thinking of humans (e1) which is manifested in stock-market booms and crashes (e2).]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[None of these.]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[DIRECTIONS for questions 1 to 4: Go through the passage below and answer the questions that follow.<br/><br/>Attempting to understand science and scientific reasoning in terms of the subjective beliefs of scientists would seem to be a disappointing departure for those who seek an objective account of science. Howson and Urbach have an answer to that charge. They insist that the Bayesian theory constitutes an objective theory of scientific inference. That is, given a set of prior probabilities and some new evidence, Bayes'' theorem dictates in an objective way what the new, posterior, probabilities must be in the light of that evidence. There is no difference in this respect between Bayesianism and deductive logic, because logic has nothing to say about the source of the propositions that constitute the premises of a deduction either. It simply dictates what follows from those propositions once they are given. The Bayesian defence can be taken a stage further. It can be argued that the beliefs of individual scientists, however much they might differ at the outset, can be made to converge given the appropriate input of evidence. It is easy to see in an informal way how this can come about. Suppose two scientists start out by disagreeing greatly about the probable truth of hypothesis h which predicts otherwise unexpected experimental outcome e.

One of the major difficulties in generating new ideas is to get going. The advantage of an analogy is that it has a life of its own. For instance, in the analogy of going fishing the process is so well known that one moves from one step to another without difficulty: finding time, choosing a stretch of water, perhaps getting a license, preparing the rod and tackle, choosing a position by the water, selecting bait,  changing  bait,  moving  about,  patience,  catching  something,  or  the  fish  that  got  away, fisherman’s stories, and so on.<br/><br/>In using  the analogy  method,  one  translates  the  problem  situation  in  to  an  analogy  and  then develops the analogy in its own right. From time to time, one translates back to the real problem to see  what  would  happen  if  the  process  taking  place  in  the analogy  took  place  in  the  problem situation.  For  instance,  the  fishing  analogy  might  have  been used  in  considering  a  management recruitment  problem.  "Stretch  of  water" would  now  read  area  of  exploration,  perhaps  campus, perhaps  business  college,  perhaps  other  corporations.  "Bait"  would  now  read  salary,  fringe benefits, stock options, promotion prospects, status, responsibility, location, or others.<br/><br/>"Fishing tackle" would now read advertising media, personal contact, interviews, word of mouth, and  the  like.  One  would  then  come  to  the  point  when  no  fish?  Perhaps  those  waters  were overfished, perhaps the bait was unsuitable, perhaps the weather conditions were not right, perhaps it was a matter of too little patience. One might then consider whether the object of the fishing was sport, the odd chance of getting something really worthwhile, or the need to have some fish to eat. If it was the last, one might consider buying fish from a professional fish catcher, buying frozen fish from a store and spending extra time cooking it, or even changing the menu so that frozen fish fitted in (fresh salmon might dominate a menu but fish fingers would not). Translated back in to the problem situation, this would all mean that if changing the incentives and the search area were unsuccessful,  then  one  ought to  have more patience, or  employ professional search agencies, or decide to spend more time on executive training on the job, or even tailor the job in such a way that exceptional executive talent was no longer required.<br/><br/>In mathematics, one translates a situation in to the symbols of a formula and then lets the formula run along its own course of development. At the end, one translates back. This is the way one uses analogies except that one does not only translate back at the end but all the way along as well.<br/><br/>Analogies serve as vehicles for processes, functions, relationships, and it is these which are being transferred to the original problem and tried out to see if they fit or what ideas they set off.

Indeed, it has so many aspects, its manifestations at different times and in different places have varied so much that by the judicious selection of facts it is easy to represent it in very conflicting ways.<br/><br/>Modern historians have shown how slow was the coming of the machine and the factory, and have stressed  the  fact that the  so-called  revolution  in  the eighteenth  century  was  almost  confined  to cotton and iron; that the date of an invention and its effective use in industry are two very different things; that in 1830 the great majority of workers were still outside the factory system; that some of the evils of transition -- and notably the misfortunes of the hand-loom weavers -- were increased because the new methods took so long to establish themselves. By tracking back origins on one hand, and by correcting false notions of the great rapidity of the change on the other, they have corrected  the  over-insistence  on  those critical  years,  so dear  to  text-books,  between  1760  and 1830. But there is no doubt at all that the time did seem epoch-making to those who lived in it, and in fact was epoch-making.<br/><br/>One might suppose the term revolution as applied to industrial change would have been suggested by the French Revolution. And so it was. Blanqui, the French economist, is said to have been the first to speak of the industrial revolution in the early nineteenth century, to show that he thought economic change  in  England  as  revolutionary  as  political  change  in  France  :  France  had  had  a political revolution, England an economic one. The idea was developed by Marx, but the term did not come in to general use till Toynbee used it in lectures given in 1881, which were published as The Industrial Revolution of the Eighteenth Century in England.<br/><br/>But before events in France had suggested the analogy, people were fond of saying that there had been a revolution in this or that industry. There was an exhilarating sense of a growing command over  Nature, and of vast possibilities of capturing the markets of the world. The inventions had supplied the country''s needs so dramatically that it seemed as if Providence had concerned itself to  make  England  the  workshop of  the  world.  The  inventions  came,  of  course,  as  the answer  to repeated  experiment,  directed  to definite ends; but achievement surpassed  expectation. While in the fifties the Society of Arts offered prizes for a machine which would spin six threads at once, the jenny, after improvements, could spin a hundred ; while the mule and the waterframe were yet more marvelous. The magazines paid great attention to new machines and processes, and the Press as   a   whole   was   eloquent   and   high-flown.   It   worked   to  death   the  epithets   ''incredible'', ''unexampled'', ''amazing'', ''unparalleled'',  and  the  like.  As  early  as  1767  an  enthusiast  said of improved roads and the first canals, ''there never was a more astonishing revolution than this''. The sober Encyclopedia Britannica averred that ''the discoveries and improvements'' of the age ''diffuse a  glory  over  this  country unattainable  by  conquest  or  dominion''.

He is met on every road of Turkestan, always hustling his beasts through a cloud of dust and lashing them right and left to keep them up to speed. He is a great burly fellow, dressed in loose clothes which increase his bulk, and his baggy trousers are stuffed in to high leather boots. His chapan (coat) is tied in with a thick belt, and he wears a round hat with a sheepskin border which mixes with his loose hair to form a shaggy frame to the weather-beaten face. One man, or at the most two, will drive twenty donkeys, riding behind them, shouting incessantly, and never letting them slacken to normal walking-pace.<br/><br/>He  mainly  conveys  melons,  early  vegetable and  fruits - apricots  peaches,  grapes  and pears according  to  season -  but  makes  up  his  load  with  rolls  of  loosely  woven,  undyed  cotton.  He knows no organization of travel life, but pushes on from stage to stage with restless energy. When the donkeys must be fed he drives them in to an inn-court, tosses the panniers from their backs, carelessly throws fodder in to the manger, pulls some hard cakes of bread from his own food-bag and sits down to a meal of bread soaked in tea. He carries with himself what he will need to eat on the road. He takes a short sleep while the animals finish their grain, then he flings himself on to his beast’s back and urges the drove on for as far as he dare before feeding them again.<br/><br/>The donkeys are small and cheap, so he is careless of life and sacrifices them in large numbers to his  passion  for  speed  and  his reckless output of strength. He will use dangerous short-cuts over which no other class of transport-man will use venture, and in bad weather many beasts die by the roadside.  This  does  not trouble  him,  and  he  just lifts  the  load  from  the exhausted  creature and divides its weight among the others, then pushes on again, regardless of suffering, to deliver the cargo  at  market,  for  he  has  a  master  as  impatient  as  himself  waiting  at the  other  end.  He  will normally do five stages in three days and nothing may stand in his way, but when the goods are handed over and he can lodge in an inn, he enjoys twenty-four hours of sheer luxury.

Great  carts  which  cross  the  Gobi link  the commercial life  of  China  proper  with  the  raw  material  markets  of  Turkestan,  and  a carter  who leaves  Kashgar  in  February  will  swing  through  the  gates  of  his  Honan home  town  in  August without having shifted his splendidly packed cargo. In the course of this phenomenal journey he will only need to change the axle a few times in order to adjust the cart to the wider desert gauge or  the narrowing Kansu or  Honan ruts. The widest axle is required between Suchow and Hami, and the narrowest in Honan.<br/><br/>The  Chinese  transport  agent  makes  constant  use of the words  ta-suan, which mean to  compute, calculate, think out, arrange ahead, organize and consider carefully. It represents a characteristic so much admired by the Chinese as to be regarded by them almost as a virtue, and is an integral part  of  their  economy  of  life.  The  man  who  can  ta-suan  gets  full  value  from  time,  strength, capacity and  money, and  anyone who  has not the intelligence to  ta-suan is, in Chinese eyes, an uncivilized barbarian.  The classic example  of  ta-suan  is  the  incident  of a Chinese general who, centuries ago, was sent out with an expeditionary force to conquer the land beyond the deserts. He sat down to ta-suan, and doing so he realized that it might be all too easy to conquer the land yet lose the campaign through inability to  feed  his own troops He therefore selected bodies of men versed  in  agriculture,  and  sent them  ahead  with  supporting  forces  to  select  suitable  sites  where they  must  plough  and  sow,  then  reap  the  harvest.  If  the  grain  were carefully  stored  against the arrival of his troops, it would support them through the following year. Thanks to such good ta- suan, he carried the campaign to a successful issue.<br/><br/>The Chinese transport system across the Gobi has been built up on the principle of ta-suan, and in entire contrast  with  the  native  genius  of  the  reckless  Turki  driver.  The  distances  which  make a possible  stage  for  man  and beast  have  been  meticulously  calculated,  as  well  as  the equipment necessary to ensure reasonable ease on the journey. The Chinese understand the art of elimination and  how  not to  encumber  themselves  with  superfluous  impedimenta.  Before  leaving home  the Chinese carter has thought out where he can exchange his money to best advantage, what goods can be bought and sold most profitably in each place, and where money invested in an extra horse or  mule  will  bring  in  most  profit.  He  leaves  Central  China with large sleek mules for  which he himself has paid a good price, but which he sells to rich Tungans at Suchow at tremendous profit, and himself buys rough but desert-hardened beasts. For the return journey he will invest some of his depreciated paper taels in good Turkestan horses, which are very cheap in Dzungaria but fetch a big price in Central China.<br/><br/>By this means his round trip has brought in many advantages apart from the straightforward profit of  his  hire.  In  manipulating  each  exchange,  this seemingly  simple creature  shows  himself  to be actually a financier of no means order, and handles the complicated money market of Central Asia like on his hands, for he has always exchanged it in time for carefully selected goods, and if he has an  employer  he  will  stipulate  that  his  wages  be  paid  at the  place and  in  the coin  most to  his advantage.<br/><br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[1]]></CorrectOption>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[According to the passage, the key difference between the Chinese carter  and the Turki transporter is]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[in their approach to life in general and business in particular.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[in their approach to the planning process for the journey.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[in their  inherent character  with the carefully planned  approach of the Chinese to the reckless aggression of the Turki driver.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[in  the  nature  of  markets  they  service,  which  dictates  their  basic  approach  to  transport management styles.]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[Direction  for  questions  1  to 4:  Read  the  passage  and  answer  the  questions  based on  the contents of the passage.<br/><br/><br/>Although the camel caravan is recognized as the best means of transport for valuable goods over great distances, yet, for local journeys or when, owing to the perishable nature of the cargo, time is of great importance, the Turki with his drove of little donkeys is the man.

Choose the best answer to each question.<br/><br/>PASSAGE I<br/><br/>Right through history, imperial powers have clung to their possessions to death. Why, then, did Britain in 1947 give up the jewel in its crown, India? For many reasons. The independence struggle exposed the hollowness of the white man''s burden. Provincial self-rule since 1935 paved the way for full self-rule. Churchill resisted independence, but the Labour government of Atlee was anti-imperialist by ideology. Finally, the Royal Indian Navy mutiny in 1946 raised fears of a second Sepoy mutiny, and convinced British waverers that it was safer to withdraw gracefully. But politico-military explanations are not enough. The basis of empire was always money. The end of empire had much to do with the fact that British imperialism had ceased to be profitable. World War II left Britain victorious but deeply indebted, needing Marshall Aid and loans from the World Bank. This constituted a strong financial case for ending the nolonger-profitable empire.<br/><br/>Empire building is expensive. The US is spending one billion dollars a day in operations in Iraq that fall well short of full-scale imperialism. Through the centuries, empire building was costly, yet constantly undertaken because it promised high returns. The investment was in armies and conquest. The returns came through plunder and taxes from the conquered.<br/><br/>No immorality was attached to imperial loot and plunder. The biggest conquerors were typically revered (hence titles like Alexander the Great, Akbar the Great, and Peter the Great). The bigger and richer the empire, the more the plunderer was admired. This mindset gradually changed with the rise of new ideas about equality and governing for the public good, ideas that culminated in the French and American revolutions. Robert Clive was impeached for making a little money on the side, and so was Warren Hastings. The white man''s burden came up as a new moral rationale for conquest. It was supposedly for the good of the conquered. This led to much muddled hypocrisy. On the one hand, the empire needed to be profitable. On the other hand, the white man''s burden made brazen loot impossible.<br/><br/>An additional factor deterring loot was the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny. Though crushed, it reminded the British vividly that they were a tiny ethnic group who could not rule a gigantic subcontinent without the support of important locals. After 1857, the British stopped annexing one princely state after another, and instead treated the princes as allies. Land revenue was fixed in absolute terms, partly to prevent local unrest and partly to promote the notion of the white man''s burden. The empire proclaimed itself to be a protector of the Indian peasant against exploitation by Indian elites. This was denounced as hypocrisy by nationalists like Dadabhoy Naoroji in the 19th century, who complained that land taxes led to an enormous drain from India to Britain. Objective calculations by historians like Angus Maddison suggest a drain of perhaps 1.6 percent of Indian Gross National Product in the 19th century.<br/><br/>But land revenue was more or less fixed by the Raj in absolute terms, and so its real value diminished rapidly with inflation in the 20th century. By World War II, India had ceased to be a profit centre for the British Empire.<br/><br/>Historically, conquered nations paid taxes to finance fresh wars of the conqueror. India itself was asked to pay a large sum at the end of World War I to help repair Britain''s finances. But, as shown by historian Indivar Kamtekar, the independence movement led by Gandhiji changed the political landscape, and made mass taxation of India increasingly difficult. By World War II, this had become politically impossible. Far from taxing India to pay for World War II, Britain actually began paying India for its contribution of men and goods. Troops from white dominions like Australia, Canada and New Zealand were paid for entirely by these countries, but Indian costs were shared by the British government. Britain paid in the form of nonconvertible sterling balances, which mounted swiftly. The conqueror was paying the conquered, undercutting the profitability on which all empire is founded. Churchill opposed this, and wanted to tax India rather than owe it money. But he was overruled by India hands who said India would resist payment, and paralyze the war effort. Leo Amery, Secretary of State for India, said that when you are driving in a taxi to the station to catch a life-or-death train, you do not loudly announce that you have doubts whether to pay the fare. Thus, World War II converted India from a debtor to a creditor with over one billion pounds in sterling balances. Britain, meanwhile, became the biggest debtor in the world.

Choose the best answer to each question.<br/><br/>PASSAGE II<br/><br/>Modern science, exclusive of geometry, is a comparatively recent creation and can be said to have originated with Galileo and Newton. Galileo was the first scientist to recognize clearly that the only way to further our understanding of the physical world was to resort to experiment. However obvious Galileo''s contention may appear in the light of our present knowledge, it remains a fact that the Greeks, in spite of their proficiency in geometry, never seem to have realized the importance of experiment. To a certain extent this may be attributed to the crudeness of their instruments of measurement. Still, an excuse of this sort can scarcely be put forward when the elementary nature of Galileo''s experiments and observations is recalled, Watching a lamp oscillate in the cathedral of Pisa, dropping bodies from the leaning tower of Pisa, rolling balls down inclined planes, noticing the magnifying effect of water in a spherical glass vase, such was the nature of Galileo''s experiments and observations. As can be seen, they might just as well have been performed by the Greeks. At any rate, it was thanks to such experiments that Galileo discovered the fundamental law of dynamics, according to which the acceleration imparted to a body is proportional to the force acting upon it.<br/><br/>The next advance was due to Newton, the greatest scientist of all time if account be taken of his joint contributions to mathematics and physics. As a physicist, he was of course an ardent adherent of the empirical method, but his greatest title to fame lies in another direction. Prior to Newton, mathematics, chiefly in the form of geometry, had been studied as a fine art without any view to its physical applications other than in very trivial cases. But with Newton all the resources of mathematics were turned to advantage in the solution of physical problems. Thenceforth mathematics appeared as an instrument of discovery, the most powerful one known to man, multiplying the power of thought just as in the mechanical domain the lever multiplied our physical action. It is this application of mathematics to the solution of physical problems, this combination of two separate fields of investigation, which constitutes the essential characteris tic of the Newtonian method. Thus problems of physics were metamorphosed into problems of mathematics.<br/><br/>But in Newton''s day the mathematical instrument was still in a very backward state of development. In this field again Newton showed the mark of genius by inventing the integral calculus. As a result of this remarkable discovery, problems, which would have baffled Archimedes, were solved with ease. We know that in Newton''s hands this new departure in scientific method led to the discovery of the law of gravitation. But here again the real significance of Newton''s achievement lay not so much in the exact quantitative formulation of the law of attraction, as in his having established the presence of law and order at least in one important realm of nature, namely, in the motions of heavenly bodies. Nature thus exhibited rationality and was not mere blind chaos and I uncertainty. To be sure, Newton''s investigations had been concerned with but a small group of natural phenomena, but it appeared unlikely that this mathematical law and order should turn out to be restricted to certain special phenomena; and the feeling was general that all the physical processes of nature would prove to be unfolding themselves according to rigorous mathematical laws.<br/><br/>When Einstein, in 1905, published his celebrated paper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies, he remarked that the difficulties, which surrounded the equations of electrodynamics, together with the negative experiments of Michelson and others, would be obviated if we extended the validity of the Newtonian principle of the relativity of Galilean motion, which applied solely to mechanical phenomena, so as to include all manner of phenomena: electrodynamics, optical, etc. When extended in this way the Newtonian principle of relativity became Einstein''s special principle of relativity. Its significance lay in its assertion that absolute Galilean motion or absolute velocity must ever escape all experimental detection. Henceforth absolute velocity should be conceived of as physical meaningless, not only in the particular realm of mechanics, as in Newton''s day, but in the entire realm of physical phenomena. Einstein''s special principle, by adding increased emphasis to this relativity of velocity, making absolute velocity metaphysically meaningless, created a still more profound distinction between velocity and accelerated or rotational motion. This latter type of motion remained absolute and real as before. It is most important to understand this point and to realize that Einstein''s special principle is merely an extension of the validity of the classical Newtonian principle to all classes of phenomena.<br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[3]]></CorrectOption>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[According to the author, why did the Greeks NOT conduct experiments to understand the physical world?]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[Apparently they did not think it necessary to experiment.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[They focused exclusively on geometry.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Their instruments of measurement were very crude.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[The Greeks considered the application of geometry to the physical world more important.]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[DIRECTIONS for Questions 16 to 20: The passage given below is followed by five questions.

I am not one of those superior persons who hold cocktail in contempt, looking upon them as barren or at best as very tryingly kaleidoscopic places for gathering, of the strangers one has to meet in them; which is no argument, for even our most intimate friends must at one time have been strangers to us. These large gatherings will be only what we make of them - if not better, they can be as good places to collect new friends from as the slave-markets of Istanbul were for slaves or New Market for race horses.<br/><br/>But they do offer more immediate enjoyment. For one thing, in them one can see the external expression life in appearance and behaviour at its widest and most varied - where one can admire beauty of body or voices remarkable either for sweetness or refinement, look on elegance of clothes or deportment. What these parties are schools for training in sociability, for in them we have to treat strangers as friends. So, in them we see social sympathy in widest commonalty spread, or at least should. We show an atrophy of the natural human instinct of getting pleasure and happiness out of other human beings if we cannot treat strangers for the moment. And I would go further and paraphrase Pater to say that not to be able to discriminate every moment some passionate attitude in those about us, even when we meet them casually, is on this short day of frost and sun which our life is, to sleep before evening.<br/><br/>So, it will be seen that my conception of social life is modest, for it makes no demands on what we have, thought it does make some on what we are.

In sum, social life is a function of vitality.<br/><br/>It is tragic, however, to observe that it is these very natural springs of social life which are drying up among us.

Choose the best answer to each question.<br/><br/>PASSAGE II<br/><br/>At the heart of the enormous boom in wine consumption that has taken place in the English-speaking world over the last two decades or so is a fascinating, happy paradox. In the days when wine was exclusively the preserve of a narrow cultural elite, bought either at auctions or from gentleman wine merchants in wing collars and bow-ties, to be stored in rambling cellars and decanted to order by one''s butler, the ordinary drinker didn''t get a look-in. Wine was considered a highly technical subject, in which anybody without the necessary ability could only fall flat on his or her face in embarrassment. It wasn''t just that you needed a refined aesthetic sensibility for the stuff if it wasn''t to be hopelessly wasted on you. It required an intimate knowledge of what came from where, and what it was supposed to taste like.<br/><br/>Those were times, however, when wine appreciation essentially meant a familiarity with the great French classics, with perhaps a smattering of other wines - like sherry and port. That was what the wine trade dealt in. These days, wine is bought daily in supermarkets and high-street chains to be consumed that evening, hardly anybody has a cellar to store it in and most don''t even possess a decanter. Above all, the wines of literally dozens of countries are available on our market. When a supermarket offers its customers a couple of fruity little numbers from Brazil, we scarcely raise an eyebrow.<br/><br/>It seems, in other words, that the commercial jungle that wine has now become has not in the slightest deterred people from plunging adventurously into the thickets in order to taste and see. Consumers are no longer intimidated by the thought of needing to know their Pouilly-Fume from their Pouilly-Fuisse, just at the very moment when there is more to know than ever before.<br/><br/>The reason for this new mood of confidence is not hard to find. It is on every wine label from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States: the name of the grape from which the wine is made.

Choose the best answer to each question.<br/><br/>PASSAGE I<br/><br/>The controversy over genetically-modified food continues unabated in the West. Genetic modification (GM) is the science by which the genetic material of a plant is altered, perhaps to make it more resistant to pests or killer weeds, or to enhance its nutritional value. Many food biotechnologists claim that GM will be a major contribution of science to mankind in the 21st century. On the other hand, large numbers of opponents, mainly in Europe, claim that the benefits of GM are a myth propagated by multinational corporations to increase their profits, that they pose a health hazard, and have therefore called for governments to ban the sale of genetically-modified food.<br/><br/>The anti-GM campaign has been quite effective in Europe, with several European Union member countries imposing a virtual ban for five years over genetically-modified food imports. Since the genetically-modified food industry is particularly strong in the United States of America, the controversy also constitutes another chapter in the US-Europe skirmishes which have become particularly acerbic after the US invasion of Iraq.<br/><br/>To a large extent, the GM controversy has been ignored in the Indian media, although Indian biotechnologists have been quite active in GM research. Several groups of Indian biotechnologists have been working on various issues connected with crops grown in India. One concrete achievement which has recently figured in the news is that of a team led by the former vice-chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Asis Datta - it has successfully added an extra gene to potatoes to enhance the protein content of the tuber by at least 30 percent. Not surprisingly, the new potato has been called the protato. The protato is now in its third year of field trials. It is quite likely that the GM controversy will soon hit the headlines in India since a spokesperson of the Indian Central government has recently announced that the government may use the protato in its midday meal programme for schools as early as next year.<br/><br/>Why should "scientific progress", with huge potential benefits to the poor and malnourished, be so controversial? The anti-GM lobby contends that pernicious propaganda has vastly exaggerated the benefits of GM and completely evaded the costs which will have to be incurred if the genetically-modified food industry is allowed to grow unchecked. In particular, they allude to different types of costs.<br/><br/>This group contends that the most important potential cost is that the widespread distribution and growth of genetically-modified food will enable the corporate world (alias the multinational corporations - MNCs) to completely capture the food chain. A "small" group of biotech companies will patent the transferred genes as well as the technology associated with them. They will then buy up the competing seed merchants and seed-breeding centres, thereby controlling the production of food at every possible level. Independent farmers, big and small, will be completely wiped out of the food industry. At best, they will be reduced to the status of being subcontractors.<br/><br/>This line of argument goes on to claim that the control of the food chain will be disastrous for the poor since the MNCs, guided by the profit motive, will only focus on the high-value food items demanded by the affluent. Thus, in the long run, the production of basic staples which constitute the food basket of the poor will taper off. However, this vastly overestimates the power of the MNCs. Even if the research promoted by them does focus on the high-value food items, much of biotechnology research is also funded by governments in both developing and developed countries. Indeed, the protato is a by-product of this type of research. If the protato passes the field trials, there is no reason to believe that it cannot be marketed in the global potato market. And this type of success story can be repeated with other basic food items.<br/><br/>The second type of cost associated with the genetically-modified food industry is environmental damage. The most common type of "genetic engineering" involves gene modification in plants designed to make them resistant to applications of weed-killers. This then enables farmers to use massive dosages of weedkillers so as to destroy or wipe out all competing varieties of plants in their fields. However, some weeds through genetically-modified pollen contamination may acquire resistance to a variety of weed-killers. The only way to destroy these weeds is through the use of ever-stronger herbicides which are poisonous and linger on in the environment.<br/><br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[3]]></CorrectOption>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[Using the clues in the passage, which of the following countries would you expect to be in the forefront of the anti-GM campaign?]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[USA and Spain.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[India and Iraq.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Germany and France.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Australia and New Zealand.]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[DIRECTIONS for Questions 16 to 20: The passage given below is followed by five questions.

Since the genetically-modified food industry is particularly strong in the United States of America, the controversy also constitutes another chapter in the US-Europe skirmishes which have become particularly acerbic after the US invasion of Iraq.<br/><br/>To a large extent, the GM controversy has been ignored in the Indian media, although Indian biotechnologists have been quite active in GM research. Several groups of Indian biotechnologists have been working on various issues connected with crops grown in India. One concrete achievement which has recently figured in the news is that of a team led by the former vice-chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Asis Datta - it has successfully added an extra gene to potatoes to enhance the protein content of the tuber by at least 30 percent. Not surprisingly, the new potato has been called the protato. The protato is now in its third year of field trials. It is quite likely that the GM controversy will soon hit the headlines in India since a spokesperson of the Indian Central government has recently announced that the government may use the protato in its midday meal programme for schools as early as next year.<br/><br/>Why should "scientific progress", with huge potential benefits to the poor and malnourished, be so controversial? The anti-GM lobby contends that pernicious propaganda has vastly exaggerated the benefits of GM and completely evaded the costs which will have to be incurred if the genetically-modified food industry is allowed to grow unchecked. In particular, they allude to different types of costs.<br/><br/>This group contends that the most important potential cost is that the widespread distribution and growth of genetically-modified food will enable the corporate world (alias the multinational corporations - MNCs) to completely capture the food chain. A "small" group of biotech companies will patent the transferred genes as well as the technology associated with them. They will then buy up the competing seed merchants and seed-breeding centres, thereby controlling the production of food at every possible level. Independent farmers, big and small, will be completely wiped out of the food industry. At best, they will be reduced to the status of being subcontractors.<br/><br/>This line of argument goes on to claim that the control of the food chain will be disastrous for the poor since the MNCs, guided by the profit motive, will only focus on the high-value food items demanded by the affluent. Thus, in the long run, the production of basic staples which constitute the food basket of the poor will taper off. However, this vastly overestimates the power of the MNCs. Even if the research promoted by them does focus on the high-value food items, much of biotechnology research is also funded by governments in both developing and developed countries. Indeed, the protato is a by-product of this type of research. If the protato passes the field trials, there is no reason to believe that it cannot be marketed in the global potato market. And this type of success story can be repeated with other basic food items.<br/><br/>The second type of cost associated with the genetically-modified food industry is environmental damage. The most common type of "genetic engineering" involves gene modification in plants designed to make them resistant to applications of weed-killers. This then enables farmers to use massive dosages of weedkillers so as to destroy or wipe out all competing varieties of plants in their fields. However, some weeds through genetically-modified pollen contamination may acquire resistance to a variety of weed-killers. The only way to destroy these weeds is through the use of ever-stronger herbicides which are poisonous and linger on in the environment.<br/><br/>]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[2]]></CorrectOption>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[Which of the following about the Indian media''s coverage of scientific research does the passage seem to suggest?]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[Indian media generally covers a subject of scientific importance when its mass application is likely.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Indian media''s coverage of scientific research is generally dependent on MNCs'' interests.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Indian media, in partnership with the government, is actively involved in publicizing the results of scientific research.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Indian media only highlights scientific research which is funded by the government.]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[DIRECTIONS for Questions 16 to 20: The passage given below is followed by five questions.

Choose the best answer for each question.<br/><br/>PASSAGE - 1<br/><br/>Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet over the past half-century, as developed economies have got much richer, people do not seem to have become happier. Surveys suggest that on average, people in America, Europe and Japan are no more pleased with their lot than in the 1950s. This is curious, because, at any given time richer people say they are happier than poorer people do. That might lead you to expect that, as a country grows richer and incomes rise, rich and poor alike would become happier.<br/><br/>However, they have not. Here lies a paradox: an individual who becomes richer becomes happier; but when society as a whole grows richer, nobody seems any more content. In recent years the study of happiness as opposed to more conventional economic measures, such as GDP per head has attracted increased attention from economists, LSE professor Richard Layard has tried to solve this paradox.<br/><br/>One explanation is habituation; improvements make people happier for a while, but the effect fades rapidly. For instance, 30 years ago central heating was considered a luxury; today it is viewed as essential. A second and more important reason is that people tend to compare their lot with that of others. For example, students at Harvard were asked whether they would prefer (a) $50,000 a year while others got half that or (b) $100,000 a year while others got twice as much. A majority chose (a). They were happy with less, as long as they were better off than others.<br/><br/>The implic''ation of all this is that people''s efforts to make themselves happier by working harder in order to earn and spend more are partly self-defeating: they may make more money, but because others do too, they do not get much happier. The unhappiness that one person''s extra income can cause to others, argues Lord Layard, is a form of pollution. Worse still, working harder in order to be able to afford more material goods could even end up making people unhappier if they do not have enough spare time, Although people value their income in relation to that of others, this does not seem to be true of their leisure time.<br/><br/>The same Harvard students were also asked to choose between (c) two weeks'' holiday, while others have only one week and (d)four weeks'' holiday while others get eight. This time a clear majority preferred (d). In other words, people''s rivalry over income does not extent to leisure. The result of this, suggests Lord Layard, is that developed societies may tend to work too hard in order to consume more material goods, and so consume too little leisure.<br/><br/>If governments'' ultimate goal is to maximize the well-being (i.e. happiness) of society, then, says Lord Layard, some highly controversial implications for public policy follow. Conventional economic theory argues that taxation distorts the choice between leisure and income. Taxes reduce the incentive to work an extra hour rather than go home, or tO put in extra effort in the hope of promotion. Many economists think that this is why Americans work longer hours than Europeans. High taxes, it is argued, have undermined Europe''s competitive edge. Lord Layard''s alternative view: not that Europeans work too little, but that Americans work too long, to keep up with the Joneses.<br/><br/>America''s economic performance is superior if judged by GDP alone. But GDP is a flawed measure of economic well-being. Happiness demands leisure as well as material consumption. Americans may be richer than Europeans, but are they any happier?]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[2]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[Which of the following is an example of habituation?]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[A senior manager who quits a high-paying cosmopolitan post for a serene countryside posting.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[A couple who buy a small car to suit their shopping schedule.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[Children who are taken to Pizza Hut or McDonalds with increasing frequency as the parents can put in less time now for preparing dinner.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[None of the above]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section I - Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[Section - I<br/>Direction for questions 1 to 16: Each of the four passages given below is followed by questions.

Choose the best answer for each question.<br/><br/>PASSAGE - 1<br/><br/>Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet over the past half-century, as developed economies have got much richer, people do not seem to have become happier. Surveys suggest that on average, people in America, Europe and Japan are no more pleased with their lot than in the 1950s. This is curious, because, at any given time richer people say they are happier than poorer people do. That might lead you to expect that, as a country grows richer and incomes rise, rich and poor alike would become happier.<br/><br/>However, they have not. Here lies a paradox: an individual who becomes richer becomes happier; but when society as a whole grows richer, nobody seems any more content. In recent years the study of happiness as opposed to more conventional economic measures, such as GDP per head has attracted increased attention from economists, LSE professor Richard Layard has tried to solve this paradox.<br/><br/>One explanation is habituation; improvements make people happier for a while, but the effect fades rapidly. For instance, 30 years ago central heating was considered a luxury; today it is viewed as essential. A second and more important reason is that people tend to compare their lot with that of others. For example, students at Harvard were asked whether they would prefer (a) $50,000 a year while others got half that or (b) $100,000 a year while others got twice as much. A majority chose (a). They were happy with less, as long as they were better off than others.<br/><br/>The implic''ation of all this is that people''s efforts to make themselves happier by working harder in order to earn and spend more are partly self-defeating: they may make more money, but because others do too, they do not get much happier. The unhappiness that one person''s extra income can cause to others, argues Lord Layard, is a form of pollution. Worse still, working harder in order to be able to afford more material goods could even end up making people unhappier if they do not have enough spare time, Although people value their income in relation to that of others, this does not seem to be true of their leisure time.<br/><br/>The same Harvard students were also asked to choose between (c) two weeks'' holiday, while others have only one week and (d)four weeks'' holiday while others get eight. This time a clear majority preferred (d). In other words, people''s rivalry over income does not extent to leisure. The result of this, suggests Lord Layard, is that developed societies may tend to work too hard in order to consume more material goods, and so consume too little leisure.<br/><br/>If governments'' ultimate goal is to maximize the well-being (i.e. happiness) of society, then, says Lord Layard, some highly controversial implications for public policy follow. Conventional economic theory argues that taxation distorts the choice between leisure and income. Taxes reduce the incentive to work an extra hour rather than go home, or tO put in extra effort in the hope of promotion. Many economists think that this is why Americans work longer hours than Europeans. High taxes, it is argued, have undermined Europe''s competitive edge.

Yet that year, the Court decided that a biologist named Chakrabarty could patent a hybridized bacterium because ''his discovery was his handiwork, not that of nature''. A majority of the judges reiterated that ''a new mineral discovered in the earth or a new plant discovered in the wild is not patentable''. Yet they believed that Chakrabarty had concocted something new using his own ingenuity. Even Chakrabarty was surprised. He had simply cultured different strains of bacteria in the belief that they would exchange genetic material in a laboratory soup. The then embryonic industry used the case to argue that patents should be issued on gene, proteins and other materials of commercial value.<br/><br/>By 1980s, the US Patent Office had embarked on a far-reaching change of policy to propel the US industry forward, routinely issuing patents on products of nature including genes, fragments of genes and human proteins. In 1987. for example, Genetics Institute Inc. was awarded a patent on erythropoietin, a protein of 165 amino acids that stimulates the production of red blood cells. It did not claim to have invented the protein: it had extracted small amounts of the naturally occurring substance from thousands of gallons of urine. Erythropoietin is now a multi-billion dollar-a-year treatment.<br/><br/>The industry''s argument is that innovation prospers only when it is rewarded. Without rewards, innovation will not take place. The barriers to entry into biotechnology are relatively low. Biotechnology companies do not have to build costly factories of high street retail outlets or invest in brand reputations. The basic units of production are bacteria manipulated to deliver therapeutically and commercially valuable substances. Without the protection of a patent, an innovative biotechnology company will find its discoveries quickly copied by later entrant. If the ownership of rights to exploit a genetic discovery were left unclear, there would be less innovation in the economy as a whole and we would all be worse off. The biotechnology industry in USA is larger than anywhere else, in part because innovators there have been allowed to patent their'' inventions''. In 1998, there were almost 1500 patents claiming rights to exploit human gene sequences.<br/><br/>Yet the ownership regime for industries and products spawned by genetics is far from settled. A practical argument is about what should be owned - the gene or the treatment. The cystic fibrosis gene, for example, is patented, and anyone who makes or uses a diagnostic kit that uses knowledge of the gene sequence has to pay royalty to the patent holder. Many would argue that this is too broad a patent, which may be excessively strong and slow down innovation. As we move into the knowledge economy, issues such as the breadth and scope of a patent, the standards of novelty, even the duration; will become more problematical. To put in another way, who should own what and for how long will become more of an issue in a knowledge driven economy. That is because incentives to exploit knowledge need to be set against the value of sharing it. Scientific enquiry proceeds as a result of collaboration, the sharing and testing of ideas. We are lucky that James Watson and his collaborator Francis Creek did not work for Genentech or Glaxo-Wellcome because every genetic researcher would now be paying a royalty to use their discovery. Genetics, as most sciences, is built on a bedrock of shared knowledge. The more basic the knowledge, the more inappropriate strong property rights and exclusive private ownership becomes. Privatization ofknowledg- may make it less likely that know-how will be shared. Perkin Elme will publish its research on the, human genome, but only once in three months and the company will reserve at least 300 genes for its own patent programme.

A majority of the judges reiterated that ''a new mineral discovered in the earth or a new plant discovered in the wild is not patentable''. Yet they believed that Chakrabarty had concocted something new using his own ingenuity. Even Chakrabarty was surprised. He had simply cultured different strains of bacteria in the belief that they would exchange genetic material in a laboratory soup. The then embryonic industry used the case to argue that patents should be issued on gene, proteins and other materials of commercial value.<br/><br/>By 1980s, the US Patent Office had embarked on a far-reaching change of policy to propel the US industry forward, routinely issuing patents on products of nature including genes, fragments of genes and human proteins. In 1987. for example, Genetics Institute Inc. was awarded a patent on erythropoietin, a protein of 165 amino acids that stimulates the production of red blood cells. It did not claim to have invented the protein: it had extracted small amounts of the naturally occurring substance from thousands of gallons of urine. Erythropoietin is now a multi-billion dollar-a-year treatment.<br/><br/>The industry''s argument is that innovation prospers only when it is rewarded. Without rewards, innovation will not take place. The barriers to entry into biotechnology are relatively low. Biotechnology companies do not have to build costly factories of high street retail outlets or invest in brand reputations. The basic units of production are bacteria manipulated to deliver therapeutically and commercially valuable substances. Without the protection of a patent, an innovative biotechnology company will find its discoveries quickly copied by later entrant. If the ownership of rights to exploit a genetic discovery were left unclear, there would be less innovation in the economy as a whole and we would all be worse off. The biotechnology industry in USA is larger than anywhere else, in part because innovators there have been allowed to patent their'' inventions''. In 1998, there were almost 1500 patents claiming rights to exploit human gene sequences.<br/><br/>Yet the ownership regime for industries and products spawned by genetics is far from settled. A practical argument is about what should be owned - the gene or the treatment. The cystic fibrosis gene, for example, is patented, and anyone who makes or uses a diagnostic kit that uses knowledge of the gene sequence has to pay royalty to the patent holder. Many would argue that this is too broad a patent, which may be excessively strong and slow down innovation. As we move into the knowledge economy, issues such as the breadth and scope of a patent, the standards of novelty, even the duration; will become more problematical. To put in another way, who should own what and for how long will become more of an issue in a knowledge driven economy. That is because incentives to exploit knowledge need to be set against the value of sharing it. Scientific enquiry proceeds as a result of collaboration, the sharing and testing of ideas. We are lucky that James Watson and his collaborator Francis Creek did not work for Genentech or Glaxo-Wellcome because every genetic researcher would now be paying a royalty to use their discovery. Genetics, as most sciences, is built on a bedrock of shared knowledge. The more basic the knowledge, the more inappropriate strong property rights and exclusive private ownership becomes. Privatization ofknowledg- may make it less likely that know-how will be shared. Perkin Elme will publish its research on the, human genome, but only once in three months and the company will reserve at least 300 genes for its own patent programme.

The modern era may be said to have begun about the year 1895.<br/>A. So great a revolution in scientific thought has not occurred since Copernicus showed that the earth went round the sun.<br/>B. The first step was the experimental demonstration that there exist little electrified bodies very much smaller than a hydrogen atom.<br/>C. Between that year and the year 1900, those researches were begun which have changed our whole conception of matter.<br/>D. Further,  these  studies  have  changed  our  whole  idea  of  the  meaning  and  purpose  of physical science.<br/>6.

According to Einstein, gravitation is an inherent property of space-time.<br/>A. Now the path of a ray of light must be just as obedient to the laws of geometry as is any other path.<br/>B. The planets, for instance, move in the way they do because they are pursuing the easiest path through the space-time continuum that surrounds them.<br/>C. Accordingly a ray of light passing through what we call a gravitational field must follow the path appropriate to that field.<br/>D. It is not that they are acted on by a force; the path they follow is the natural ''straight line'' path in a region governed by that particular kind of non-Euclidean geometry.<br/>6. This means, in practice, that a ray of light from a distant star, passing near the sun will be deflected, and the star will appear displaced in the sky.<br/>]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[CABD ]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[BDAC ]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[ACDB ]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[CDBA]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section I - Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[Directions for questions 29 - 30 : Arrange the sentences  A, B, C and D to form a logical sequence between sentences 1 and 6.]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[2]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[The Fortune Index of Paradise Stock Market is based on the following four stocks with weightages as Leviance - 30%, Letco - 30%, LLH - 20% and Lyfosyn - 20%.

From the statement I we get sequence of jumping can be any one of RMV, RVM, MVR, or VMR, where R stands for Ravi, V stands for Vikas, and M stands for Mahesh. From statement II we get that Ravi was not the first to land. Thus there can be either 1 person landing before Ravi (landing sequence MRV) or 2 people landing before Ravi (landing sequence MVR or VMR). From statement III we get there should be either 2 people or 3 people jumping before Mahesh (as the number of people jumping before Mahesh has to be more than those landing before Ravi). 3 people jumping before Mahesh is not possible as there are only 3 persons including Mahesh. Thus 2 people have jumped before Mahesh.

All I know is I don’t like that brand of advertising. For the non-initiated, let me clarify; for a few months now, Mumbai’s ugly enough landscape has been further sullied by an aggressive billboard campaign featuring a character called Balbir Pasha. Written as tantalizing teasers, the ads are meant to generate AIDS awareness at the most basic level.<br/><br/>I’m assuming the premise goes thus: men go to prostitutes. Men don’t wear condoms. Men get or give AIDS. Everybody suffers. AIDS kills. Thus far, no problem. But for god’s sake, the approach and treatment are both so damn crude. One series plastered across my daughter’s school showed a sex-worker called Manjula discussing her regular client — Balbir Pasha. The message in Hindi was direct an obscene. Anandita, 13-year-old, wanted to know more about Manjula. She thought Balbir Pasha was a Boilywood hero. And that the billboards were advertising the latest blockbuster.<br/><br/>The very next day, while on my way to collect her, I passed a rundown cinema hail. One of the posters featured Balbir Pasha. The other one was busy plugging a porno film called Miss Bambola. (I kid you not) I happened to be at the traffic signal when the matinee show got over. As an ancient doorman let the crowd out, I noticed there wasn’t a single woman in the audience. Not one woman, even for the record. As the theatre emptied out, I took a quick look at the long queue waiting to get in for the next show (another porn film called Stree). Again, no women.<br/><br/>I found that rather surprising. Are women not interested in pornography? I do not believe that. Are women too embarrassed to be seen at a public porno screening? Perhaps. But hey — this is the 21st century. Why the coyness?<br/><br/>Another random thought: the unending stream of men leaving the cinema hail didn’t represent a pattern’. There were all kinds of fellows in that crowd — office types, well-dressed ‘gentlemen’, lungi-clad labourers, young boys, even a few 80-year-olds. The expressions on their faces were mixed — embarrassment meets defiance. As they blinked in the harsh light of a bright, clear afternoon, their body language gave nothing away. They could as well have been emerging from a religious discourse. Were they, intact, Balbr Pashas in search of obliging Manjulas?<br/><br/>Various social organizations have protested that the Pasha ads are in poor taste. Also, that they are sexist and offensive in their representation of sex-workers. Some canny filmmaker, who has capitalized on the bombardment of the hoardings, obviously has no compunctions taking maximum advantage of the branding.<br/><br/>There’s a cheap little trick there. -<br/><br/>Unfortunately, under all this sleaze and double-speak, one very vital issue is getting completely lost— what do we do about the AIDS menace? Clearly, we have failed to address the problem. And while the efforts of Hollywood personalities, like Richard Gere, are praiseworthy, where is the long-term commitment? The infrastructure? The funding? Who will monitor these programmes?<br/><br/>Unlike in the western world, where AIDS has been identified and tackled on a war footing, the story here is significantly different. Maybe, I am wrong. Maybe the brains behind the Balbir Pasha campaign are right. Maybe, it was necessary to create an obnoxious character like Balbir Pasha and jolt our consciousness.<br/><br/>But the tone, approach and language used in furthering the message have been revolting. And I fear, pretty misleading as well. For someone not savvy enough to get the message, the campaign could be read all wrong. My daughter asked me whether only men who patronized prostitutes got AIDS. She did not ask whether the prostitutes themselves contracted it from the men. Or even whether either was a potential carrier of the deadly virus.<br/><br/>If the campaign was intended to put the fear of god only into habitual patrons of sex workers, what was the point in plastering the entire city with those ghastly posters?<br/><br/>I recall the first teaser. It asked (in Hindi) whether Balbir Pasha would eventually contract AIDS. Sure, I noticed the billboard. So did everybody else in Mumbal. But then, we all noticed Richard Gere, too. (Is it possible to ignore one of the world’s sexiest men?) I still don’t know how the two men (one fictitious, the other real) will raise our consciousness and fight AIDS. As publicity stunts, both worked brilliantly.

All I know is I don’t like that brand of advertising. For the non-initiated, let me clarify; for a few months now, Mumbai’s ugly enough landscape has been further sullied by an aggressive billboard campaign featuring a character called Balbir Pasha. Written as tantalizing teasers, the ads are meant to generate AIDS awareness at the most basic level.<br/><br/>I’m assuming the premise goes thus: men go to prostitutes. Men don’t wear condoms. Men get or give AIDS. Everybody suffers. AIDS kills. Thus far, no problem. But for god’s sake, the approach and treatment are both so damn crude. One series plastered across my daughter’s school showed a sex-worker called Manjula discussing her regular client — Balbir Pasha. The message in Hindi was direct an obscene. Anandita, 13-year-old, wanted to know more about Manjula. She thought Balbir Pasha was a Boilywood hero. And that the billboards were advertising the latest blockbuster.<br/><br/>The very next day, while on my way to collect her, I passed a rundown cinema hail. One of the posters featured Balbir Pasha. The other one was busy plugging a porno film called Miss Bambola. (I kid you not) I happened to be at the traffic signal when the matinee show got over. As an ancient doorman let the crowd out, I noticed there wasn’t a single woman in the audience. Not one woman, even for the record. As the theatre emptied out, I took a quick look at the long queue waiting to get in for the next show (another porn film called Stree). Again, no women.<br/><br/>I found that rather surprising. Are women not interested in pornography? I do not believe that. Are women too embarrassed to be seen at a public porno screening? Perhaps. But hey — this is the 21st century. Why the coyness?<br/><br/>Another random thought: the unending stream of men leaving the cinema hail didn’t represent a pattern’. There were all kinds of fellows in that crowd — office types, well-dressed ‘gentlemen’, lungi-clad labourers, young boys, even a few 80-year-olds. The expressions on their faces were mixed — embarrassment meets defiance. As they blinked in the harsh light of a bright, clear afternoon, their body language gave nothing away. They could as well have been emerging from a religious discourse. Were they, intact, Balbr Pashas in search of obliging Manjulas?<br/><br/>Various social organizations have protested that the Pasha ads are in poor taste. Also, that they are sexist and offensive in their representation of sex-workers. Some canny filmmaker, who has capitalized on the bombardment of the hoardings, obviously has no compunctions taking maximum advantage of the branding.<br/><br/>There’s a cheap little trick there. -<br/><br/>Unfortunately, under all this sleaze and double-speak, one very vital issue is getting completely lost— what do we do about the AIDS menace? Clearly, we have failed to address the problem. And while the efforts of Hollywood personalities, like Richard Gere, are praiseworthy, where is the long-term commitment? The infrastructure? The funding? Who will monitor these programmes?<br/><br/>Unlike in the western world, where AIDS has been identified and tackled on a war footing, the story here is significantly different.

The cosmos is His theatre, there are many different steps in His repertory, He Himself is actor and audience.<br/><br/>How many various dances of Shiva are known to His worshippers, I cannot say. No doubt the root idea behind all of these dances is more or less one and the same, the manifestation of primal rhythmic energy. Shiva is the Eros Protogonos of Lucian, when he wrote:<br/><br/>“It would seem that dancing came into being at the beginning of all things, and was brought to light together with Eros, that ancient one, for we see this primeval dancing clearly set forth in the choral dance of the constellations, and in the planets and fixed stars, their interweaving and interchange and orderly harmony.”<br/><br/>I do not mean to say that the most profound interpretation of Shiva’s dance was present in the minds of those, who first danced in frantic, and perhaps intoxicated energy, in honour of the pre-Aryan hill-god, afterwards merged in Shiva. A great motif in religion or art, any great symbol, becomes all things to all men; age after age it yields to men such treasure as they find in their own hearts. Whatever the origins of Shiva’s dance, it became in time the clearest image of the activity of God which any art or religion can boast of. Of the various dances of Shiva I shall only speak of three, one of them alone forming the main subject of interpretation. The first is an evening dance in the Himalayas, with a divine chorus, described as follows in the Shiva Pradosha Stotra:<br/><br/>“Placing the Mother of the Three Worlds upon a golden throne, studded with precious gems, Shulapani dances on the heights of Kailasa, and all the gods gather round Him:<br/><br/>Sarasvati plays on the vina, Indra on thc flute, Brahma holds the time-marking cymbals, Lakshmi begins a song, Vishnu plays on a drum, and all the gods stand roundabout:<br/><br/>Gandharvas, Yakshas, Patagas, Uragas, Siddhas, Sadhyas, Vidyadharas, Amaras, Apsaras, and all the beings dweing in the three worlds assemble there to witness the celestial dance and hear the music of the divine choir at the hour of twilight.”<br/><br/>This evenina dance is also referred to in the invocation preceding the Katha SaritSagara.<br/><br/>In the pictures of this dance, Shiva is two-handed, and the cooperation of the gods is clearly indicated in their position of chorus. There is no prostrate Asura trampled under Shiva’s feet. So far as I know, no special interpretations of this dance occur in Shaiva literature.<br/><br/>The second well known dance of Shiva is called the Tandava, and belongs to His tamasic aspect as Bhairava or Virabhadra. It is performed in cemeteries and burning grounds, where Shiva, usually in ten- armed form, dances wildly with Devi, accompanied by troops of capering imps.<br/><br/>Representations of this dance are common amongst ancient sculptures, as at Ellora, Elephanta, and also Bhuvaneshvara. The taridava dance is in origin that of a pre-Arvan divinity, half-god, half-demon, who holds his midnight revels in the burning ground. In later times, this dance in the cremation ground, sometimes of Shiva, sometimes of Devi, is interpreted in Shaiva and Shakta literature in a most touching and prGfäund sense.<br/><br/>Thirdly, we have the Nadanta dance of Nataraja before the assembly (‘sabt1a in the golden hail of Chidambaram or Tiilai, the centre of the Universe, first revealed to gods and rishis after the submission of the latter in the forest of Taragam, as related to the Koyll Puranam. The legend, which has after all, no very close connection with the real meaning of the dance, may be summarized as follows:<br/><br/>In the forest of Taragam dwelt multitudes of heretical rishis, following of the Mimamsa. Thither proceeded Shiva to confute them, accompanied by Vishnu disguised as a beautiful woman, and Ati-Sheshan. The rishis were at first led to violent dispute amongst themselves, but their anger was soon directed against Shiva, and they endeavoured to destroy Him by means of incantations. A fierce tiger was created in sacr!ficial fires, and rushed upon Him; but smiling gently, He seized it and, with the nail of His little finger, stripped off its skin, and wrapped it about Himself like a silken cloth! Undiscouraged by failure, the sages renewed their offerings, and produced a monstrous serpent, which however, Shiva seized and wreathed about His neck like a garland. Then He began to dance; but there rushed upon Him a last monster in the shape of a malignant dwarf, Muyalaka. Upon him the God pressed the tip of His foot, and broke the creature’s back, so that it writhed upon the ground; and so, His last foe prostrate, Shiva resumed the dance, witnessed by gods and rishis.]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[4]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[What does the author mean when he says, “He Himself is actor and audience”?]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[Shiva both acts and is acted upon.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[There are many steps in his repertory.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[He dances as well as watches the dance of the cosmos.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[He dances and others dance in his honour.]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section III - Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[<br/>PASSAGE - ll<br/><br/>Among the greatest of the names of Shiva is Nataraja, Lord of Dancers, or King of Actors.

The legend, which has after all, no very close connection with the real meaning of the dance, may be summarized as follows:<br/><br/>In the forest of Taragam dwelt multitudes of heretical rishis, following of the Mimamsa. Thither proceeded Shiva to confute them, accompanied by Vishnu disguised as a beautiful woman, and Ati-Sheshan. The rishis were at first led to violent dispute amongst themselves, but their anger was soon directed against Shiva, and they endeavoured to destroy Him by means of incantations. A fierce tiger was created in sacr!ficial fires, and rushed upon Him; but smiling gently, He seized it and, with the nail of His little finger, stripped off its skin, and wrapped it about Himself like a silken cloth! Undiscouraged by failure, the sages renewed their offerings, and produced a monstrous serpent, which however, Shiva seized and wreathed about His neck like a garland. Then He began to dance; but there rushed upon Him a last monster in the shape of a malignant dwarf, Muyalaka. Upon him the God pressed the tip of His foot, and broke the creature’s back, so that it writhed upon the ground; and so, His last foe prostrate, Shiva resumed the dance, witnessed by gods and rishis.]]></Directions>        <CorrectOption><![CDATA[1]]></CorrectOption>        <Solution><![CDATA[-]]></Solution>    </question>    <question>        <QuestionText><![CDATA[We can infer that after this passage]]></QuestionText>        <options>            <option><![CDATA[the author would give a detailed interpretation of the Nadanta dance.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[the author would discuss in greater detail the three dances of Shiva.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[the author would go on to talk about Shiva as the destroyer.]]></option>            <option><![CDATA[None of these]]></option>        </options>        <Section><![CDATA[Section III - Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension]]></Section>        <Directions><![CDATA[<br/>PASSAGE - ll<br/><br/>Among the greatest of the names of Shiva is Nataraja, Lord of Dancers, or King of Actors.

No doubt the root idea behind all of these dances is more or less one and the same, the manifestation of primal rhythmic energy. Shiva is the Eros Protogonos of Lucian, when he wrote:<br/><br/>“It would seem that dancing came into being at the beginning of all things, and was brought to light together with Eros, that ancient one, for we see this primeval dancing clearly set forth in the choral dance of the constellations, and in the planets and fixed stars, their interweaving and interchange and orderly harmony.”<br/><br/>I do not mean to say that the most profound interpretation of Shiva’s dance was present in the minds of those, who first danced in frantic, and perhaps intoxicated energy, in honour of the pre-Aryan hill-god, afterwards merged in Shiva. A great motif in religion or art, any great symbol, becomes all things to all men; age after age it yields to men such treasure as they find in their own hearts. Whatever the origins of Shiva’s dance, it became in time the clearest image of the activity of God which any art or religion can boast of. Of the various dances of Shiva I shall only speak of three, one of them alone forming the main subject of interpretation. The first is an evening dance in the Himalayas, with a divine chorus, described as follows in the Shiva Pradosha Stotra:<br/><br/>“Placing the Mother of the Three Worlds upon a golden throne, studded with precious gems, Shulapani dances on the heights of Kailasa, and all the gods gather round Him:<br/><br/>Sarasvati plays on the vina, Indra on thc flute, Brahma holds the time-marking cymbals, Lakshmi begins a song, Vishnu plays on a drum, and all the gods stand roundabout:<br/><br/>Gandharvas, Yakshas, Patagas, Uragas, Siddhas, Sadhyas, Vidyadharas, Amaras, Apsaras, and all the beings dweing in the three worlds assemble there to witness the celestial dance and hear the music of the divine choir at the hour of twilight.”<br/><br/>This evenina dance is also referred to in the invocation preceding the Katha SaritSagara.<br/><br/>In the pictures of this dance, Shiva is two-handed, and the cooperation of the gods is clearly indicated in their position of chorus. There is no prostrate Asura trampled under Shiva’s feet. So far as I know, no special interpretations of this dance occur in Shaiva literature.<br/><br/>The second well known dance of Shiva is called the Tandava, and belongs to His tamasic aspect as Bhairava or Virabhadra. It is performed in cemeteries and burning grounds, where Shiva, usually in ten- armed form, dances wildly with Devi, accompanied by troops of capering imps.<br/><br/>Representations of this dance are common amongst ancient sculptures, as at Ellora, Elephanta, and also Bhuvaneshvara. The taridava dance is in origin that of a pre-Arvan divinity, half-god, half-demon, who holds his midnight revels in the burning ground.
